    <lb/>The Implications of the Coercion of Νεκυδαίμoνες on the Language of Agogē Spells</head><p/></div><div type="main"><p>	The explicitly violent and sexual language employed by the <q type="soCalled">authors</q> of Greco-Egyptian ἀγωγὴ spells raises several important questions about the relationships between the people implicated in and by these spells. Does the author/spell-caster/client genuinely desire the extreme physical, mental, emotional, and erotic subjugation of the target individual, or does this exaggerated language reflect a generic tendency somehow related to the perceived operation of Greek love-magic? If the former, then what cultural attitude(s) permit(s) the expression of sexual desire in the form of such aggressive discourse? If the latter, then what specific aspect of an ἀγωγὴ spell demands the use of this language? Finally, can discussion of this problem shed any light on the agency or pragmatic operation of the magical procedures involved in an ἀγωγὴ spell? I contend that a close examination of <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.297-434<ptr type="footnote" target="fn1"/> and the activated spells in the <i type="title">Supplementum Magicum</i><ptr type="footnote" target="fn2"/> based on this or a similar model, understood within the context of other spells which employ a νεκυδαίμων (or multiple νεκυδαίμονες) as the vehicle and/or agent for the magical action, reveals that the violent language of ἀγωγὴ spells derives from the relationship between the spell-writer/caster and that targeted spirit.</p><p>	Before an examination of these relationships can be assayed, it is necessary to examine the individuals involved in a given ἀγωγὴ spell. In the case of activated spells derived from a handbook, at an absolute minimum, three individuals must have been involved in the casting of a spell – the <i>author</i> of the model, the <i>spell-caster</i> who adapted the spell,<ptr type="footnote" target="fn3"/> and the specific <i>client</i> who purchased the spell – in addition to the <i>target</i> individual. This classification of the human agents in an <i type="term">agogē</i> spell was motivated by Versnel's discussion of the individuals involved in healing charms: <q type="quote">the basic rôles or participants are the practitioner/magician, the patient/client and the object (the disease).</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn4"/> Although Frankfurter locates the Greek magical papyri <q type="quote">among innovative members of the Egyptian priesthood during the third-/fourth-century decline of the Egyptian temple infrastructure,</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn5"/> speculation about the specific identities of the <i>author</i> and <i>spell-caster</i> lies beyond the scope of this paper.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn6"/> For the activated spells in the <i type="title">Supplementum Magicum</i>, the names of the <i>client</i> and <i>target</i> individuals are expressed; however, this limited information does not reveal important details such as their occupations or status within their family and community. Despite speculation that the <i>target</i> was frequently a prostitute,<ptr type="footnote" target="fn7"/> there is little direct evidence that such low-status individuals were the sole appropriate target of <i type="term">agogē</i> spells in the context of Roman Egypt. These factors limit the potential for defining the relationship between the human actors involved in an <i type="term">agogē</i> spell in terms of normal social hierarchies. </p><p>      Although the magical language of Greek spells obfuscates the <q type="soCalled">real</q> social status of their human agents, several factors may indicate the existence of a hierarchical relationship between <i>author</i>, <i>spell-caster</i>, and <i>client</i> that was defined in terms of competency in the magical arts.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn8"/> Frankfurter affirms that literate experts attained <q type="quote">a unique prestige in the community</q> as a result of their magical expertise and connection to established religion.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn9"/> He locates this proficiency in their ability to <q type="quote">transform the rational or 'informative' sense of sacred tests into a 'performative' sense, producing the numinous, empowered letter, amulet, or edible verse out of the official words, prayers, and pages of scripture.</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn10"/> Frankfurter's <q type="quote">craftsmen of the written word</q> clearly occupied a position of magical authority in reference to the layman<i>client</i> of the spell, regardless of their respective status in normal society. </p><p>      The relationship between the <i>spell-caster</i> and the original <i>author</i> of the <i type="term">agogē</i> spells contained in the magical handbooks is more speculative. If Frankfurter's assertion that the <i type="title">PGM</i> spells were the product of Egyptian temple priests versed in both Egyptian and Greek magical traditions, then there is no apparent class-differentiation in magical proficiency between the original <i>authors</i> and the <i>spell-casters</i> who activated the spells. However, many of the <i type="title">PGM</i> spells are introduced by claims of their spectacular efficacy,<ptr type="footnote" target="fn11"/> and in some cases, attribution to a named magical figure, sometimes linked to Thessaly, Syria, or Egypt, areas frequently associated with legendary magical power and expertise.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn12"/> While these claims are clearly a type of advertisement for the spell designed to encourage its use, they base their claim to authority on an implied <i>universal</i><ptr type="footnote" target="fn13"/> history of magic and a genealogy of its legendary practitioners. Regardless of the actual source for the <i type="title">PGM</i> spells, their assertion of mythical origin implies a status for the <i>author</i>, the creative force behind a spell, higher than that of the <i>spell-caster</i>, the technician responsible for their activation. </p><gap desc="figure"/><p>      The human actors implicated in these <i type="term">agogē</i> spells form a hierarchical chain of magical authority, ultimately derived from the realm of the mythical and/or legendary mages of a more ancient time or exotic location, and, to a certain degree, separate from the normal hierarchical relationships of these actors within the social structures of Greco-Roman Egypt. Namely, the  <i>client</i> and/or <i>target</i> of any given activated spell may have occupied a higher social status than the <i>spell-caster</i> in everyday activities, especially if the <i>spell-caster</i> was an itinerant practitioner; however, within the context of magical activities, the <i>spell-caster</i> always operated as the more prominent individual, although subordinated to the absent <i>author</i> of the spell. This authoritative model for the participants in <i type="term">agogē</i> spells provides a focus for the analysis of the of the language directed at the <i>target</i> and the νεκυδαίμων in the <i type="term">logoi</i> of these spells.</p><div type="head_1"><head>Violence Directed at the Target of the Spell</head><p>	The language employed by the <i>authors</i> of many of the <i type="term">agogē</i> or erotic spells in <i type="title">PGM</i> and the <i type="title">Supplementum Magicum</i> involves extreme violence and/or explicit sexual actions directed towards the <i>target</i> of the spell: <q type="quote">incantations that are… dense with imagery connected with torture and cruelty.</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn14"/> In addition to the sexual component, generally a demand for exclusivity in the desired relationship between the <i>client</i> and <i>target</i>, Faraone asserts that <q type="quote">there are a large number of erotic spells that generally aim at torturing the victim with fire, itching, hunger, thirst, and insomnia.</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn15"/> The <i>logos</i>, the incantation addressed to a νεκυδαίμων, of <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.296-466 provides an example of this type of expression: </p><p><q type="quote">ἄξον τὴν δεῖνα, ἣν δεῖνα, ἧς ἔχεις τὴν οὐσίαν, φιλοῦσάν με τὸν δεῖνα, ὃν ἔτεκεν ἡ δεῖνα: μὴ βινηθήτω, μὴ πυγισθήτω μηδὲ πρὸς ἡδονὴν ποιήσῃ μετ’ ἄλλου ἀνδρός, εἰ μὴ μετ’ ἐμοῦ μόνου, τοῦ δεῖνα, ἵνα μὴ δυνηθῇ ἡ δεῖνα μήτε πεῖν μήτε φαγεῖν, μὴ στέργειν, μὴ καρτερεῖν, μὴ εὐσταθῆσαι, μὴ ὕπνου τυχεῖν ἡ δεῖνα ἐκτὸς ἐμοῦ, τοῦ δεῖνα</q> (350-356).</p><p>Similar terminology is repeated in lines 372-383 and 395-6, where the <i>spell-caster</i> is instructed to <q type="quote">add the usual</q> (κοινόν), presumably a text similar to lines 350-356 and 372-383. Moreover, the desired result of the spell is also expressed to the νεκυδαίμων in dominating sexual language at the conclusion of the logos: </p><p><q type="quote">ἵνα μοι ἄξῃς τὴν δεῖνα καὶ κεφαλὴν κεφαλῇ κολλήσῃ καὶ χείλεσι συνάψῃ καὶ γαστέρα γαστρὶ κολλήσῃ καὶ μηρὸν μηρῷ πελάσῃ καὶ τὸ μέλαν τῷ μέλανι συναρμόσῃ καὶ τὰ ἀφροδισιακὰ ἑαυτῆς ἐκτελέσῃ ἡ δεῖνα μετ’ ἐμοῦ, τοῦ δεῖνα, εἰς τὸν ἅπαντα χρόνον τοῦ αἰῶνος</q> (400-406). </p><p>Other instances of this mode of discourse can be found in <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.1390-1495, <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.1469-1595, <i type="title">PGM</i> XVI.1-75, <i type="title">PGM</i> LXI.1-38, <i type="title">PGM</i> CI.1-53, and <i type="title">Supplementum Magicum</i> 46-50, among others. </p><p> The elements contained in these expressions of violence include, as mentioned above, the physical discomfort and torture of the <i>target</i> and the restraint of the <i>target</i>'s (normal) sexual activities until the <i>target</i> fulfills the <i>client</i>’s desires. These conditional commands are typically interspersed with claims of power by the <i>author</i>/<i>spell-caster</i>, <i type="term">voces magicae</i>, and other injunctions to the νεκυδαίμων. The conditional aspect could possibly be seen as an alleviation of the violence; however, the expressed objective of these logoi, the absolute subjugation of the target, undermines any perception of mitigation. In the activated spells of the <i type="title">Supplementum Magicum</i> that follow the basic format of <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.296-46, the νεκυδαίμων is instructed to make the target inseparable from and subject to the<i>client</i>: <q type="quote">ἀδιαχώριστὸν μου αὐτὴν ποιήσῃς μέχρι θανάτου, ἵν’ ἔχω αὐτὴν Ἡρωνοῦν, ἣν ἔτεκεν Πτολεμαΐς, ὑποτεταγμένην ἐγὼ Ποσιδώνιος, ὃν ἔτεκεν Θσενουβάσθις, ἰς τὸν ἅπαντα χρόνον τῆς ζωῆς μου</q> (46.24-26).<ptr type="footnote" target="fn16"/> The desired result of an <i type="term">agogē</i> spell is expressed elsewhere in <i type="title">PGM</i> as the complete suppression of the target's thoughts and will to the<i>client</i>: <q type="quote">καὶ μεταζήτησιν τῶν ἐμῶν τύπων καὶ θέλησιν τῶν ἐμῶν θελημάτων, ἄχρις ἄν ποιήσῃ τὰ ἐπιτασσόμενα αὐτῇ ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ</q> (<i type="title">PGM</i> IV.1429-1431).<ptr type="footnote" target="fn17"/> The result of these assertions is the complete effacement of the <i>target</i>'s identity, which is replaced by the desires of the <i>client</i>.</p><p>      The exaggerated, almost sadistic, aggression expressed in the <i type="term">logoi</i> of <i type="term">agogē</i> spells has created a locus of discussion for the interpretation of Greek erotic magic. While understanding the ambivalent hostility of Greek attitudes towards erotic love in a non-magical context can explain some of the violence, the sheer density and brutality of these images in erotic magic defies explanation through <q type="quote">traditional descriptions of the effects of erotic seizure.</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn18"/> In other words, the conceptualization of (violent) passion in Greek poetry may help to explain the association of erotic magic with violent language, but cannot account for the degree of brutality expressed in the spells. In addition, the violent imagery contained in most lyric poetry affects the speaker/poet, roughly equivalent to the <i>client</i> in the erotic spells. If there is a correlation between <q type="soCalled">erotic seizure</q> and the <i type="term">agogē</i> spells, then the imagery has somehow been transferred from <i>client</i> to <i>target</i>, establishing an analogy – since I (= the<i>client</i>) feel this way, then you (= the target) must also feel this way – which is not directly evidenced in the spells. Instead, the analogies directly expressed in the <i>logoi</i> equate the desired disturbance of the <i>target</i> to a magical substance used in the <i>praxis</i> of the spell.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn19"/></p><p>      The analogy between erotic magic and lyric/elegiac poetry also fails to elucidate another central question concerning violent language in erotic magic: when the <i>author</i>/<i>spell-caster</i>/<i>client</i> commanded the νεκυδαίμων to torture the target, did the<i>client</i> believe that the target would actually suffer? And, if he did, was the <i>target</i>’s suffering physical or mental? In his analysis of Pythian 4, Faraone asserts that <q type="quote">the practitioner hoped to compound the naturally deviant behavior of the bird with the discomfort and madness caused by torture, and to project the resulting mental turmoil and physical anguish onto the victim.</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn20"/> The torture of the iunx-bird, functioning as an effigy of the<i>target</i>, is used to create an agitated mental state in Medea <q type="quote">in the hope that she forget her proper respect for home and family and run away with her seducer,</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn21"/> a combination of sympathetic and persuasive magical techniques. Faraone connects the violent language in the spells to the agitated and deviant behavior desired for the<i>target</i> of this particular spell. </p><p>The violence expressed in these spells is reminiscent of the language employed by the Greek defixiones which bind (καταδέω) the body-parts and (sexual) organs of their targets. The self-description of <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.296-46 as a φιλτροκατάδεσμος indicates that a relationship between defixiones and erotic magic was potentially recognized by the <i>author(s)</i> of the <i type="title">PGM</i> spells, and, indeed, the concept of <q type="quote">binding</q> or <q type="quote">restraint</q> forms a motif in both the logos and praxis of many of these spells.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn22"/> Faraone analyzed the expression of violence in the curse-tablets within the agonistic context of Greek legal and commercial enterprise, and has concluded that in these circumstances the aggression was not imagined as literal violence.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn23"/> The <i>author</i>/<i>spell-caster</i>/<i>client</i> of a given curse tablet assimilated the violent language of the spell to the <q type="quote">restraint</q> of the<i>target</i>, transformed from literal to magical through the operation of the chthonic divinities, and resulting in the<i>client</i> overcoming his/her competitor(s).<ptr type="footnote" target="fn24"/></p><p>      However, this disjunction between magical discourse and the real social relationships that provide the context for Greek magic has generally not been extended into the framework of erotic magic.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn25"/> Instead, interpretations of the agogē spells have focused on other aspects of the spells,<ptr type="footnote" target="fn26"/> or assumed that the violence reflected a generalized societal perception of women in Roman Egypt. Versnel, in his discussion of healing charms, approaches magical rhetoric as the transgression of the normal bounds of discourse:</p><p><q type="quote">Yet, although certainly being a rhetorical art, magic is both more than and, in many respects, different from 'normal rhetoric'. For, as we have seen time and again, in the magical spell rhetoric often runs wild in explosions of repetition, variation and transformation of such hyperbolic dimensions as could never be tolerated in normal communication, since they would entail its ruin.</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn27"/></p><p>This exaggerated approach to language provides a potential explanation for the degree of brutality employed in the logoi of many erotic spells, although it does not completely explain the rationale behind this inversion of normal discourse. Unless we are to assume that all the practitioners and<i>client</i>s of Greek love magic bordered on the sadistic, the exaggerated and violent language employed in the logoi should have some basis in the operation of the spells or in their underlying magical <q type="soCalled">logic</q>. However, the human actors – <i>author</i>, <i>spell-caster</i>,<i>client</i>, and<i>target</i> – are not the only entities involved in the production and activation of Greek erotic magic. </p></div><div type="head_1"><head>The Conditional Coercion of the Νεκυδαίμων</head><p>      The logoi of agogē spells are typically addressed to one or more νεκυδαίμονες, the unfulfilled spirits of people who died prematurely (aōroi) or by violence (biaiothanotoi),<ptr type="footnote" target="fn28"/> and who functioned as the direct agents of the spell.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn29"/> These <q type="quote">restless</q> spirits existed in a state of suspension between life and death which <q type="quote">would both facilitate interaction with the living and make them easier prey for the practitioner – they were neither impeded nor protected by the walls of the Underworld.</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn30"/> Because the spirits of the <q type="quote">restless</q> dead existed outside both the society of the living and the dead, they provided Greek magical practitioners with the ideal medium for communication between both worlds. These (νεκυ)δαίμoνες appear in other <i type="title">PGM</i> spells in addition to erotic contexts, frequently as the vehicle for (dream) oracles or as a magical assistant (πάρεδρος) of some other type,<ptr type="footnote" target="fn31"/> and their use might be recognized as a central, although not well-understood, factor in the practical operation of Greek magic. Thus, the language directed at the νεκυδαίμων or νεκυδαίμoνες summoned by a practitioner of Greek magic may help explicate the role of violent imagery in the logoi of erotic spells.  </p><p>      Since these Greek erotic spells represent the νεκυδαίμων as an active participant in the magical process, the interaction between the <i>spell-caster</i> and the νεκυδαίμων adds another dimension to the analysis of the hierarchical and/or violent relationships between the human actors described in the logoi. The use of νεκυδαίμoνες in Greek magic depended on the ability of magical practitioners to communicate effectively with the spirits of the dead, and assumed a certain degree of consciousness, at least on the part of the <q type="quote">restless</q> dead. Johnston asserts that <q type="quote">Greek funerary rites attest to the expectation that the deceased had some sentience in the afterlife.</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn32"/> This communication with the νεκυδαίμoνες appears to have taken the form of both the epodai attested in the spell's logoi, the rituals and sacrifices described in the praxeis of these spells, and possibly even through characterēs. Some <q type="quote">oracle</q> spells appear to indicate that the νεκυδαίμων could also <q type="quote">speak</q> to the <i>spell-caster</i>, either directly<ptr type="footnote" target="fn33"/> or through dreams,<ptr type="footnote" target="fn34"/> implying that νεκυδαίμoνες were capable of linguistic communication. However, the existence of these consultations does not reveal any specific details about the rationality of νεκυδαίμoνες, or their memories or perceptions of the society of those still living.</p><p>Some details about how the <i>author</i>/<i>spell-caster</i> viewed the νεκυδαίμoνες can be reconstructed from language incorporated into the logoi. The spirits used in erotic magic were apparently tied to the location of a tomb, or cemetery, <q type="quote">ὁρκίζω πάντας δαίμονας τοὺς ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ,</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn35"/> or even to their skeleton.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn36"/> Other indications in the language used to address these νεκυδαίμονες reveal that they were paradoxically thought to be <q type="quote">at rest</q> until <q type="quote">aroused</q> by the <i>spell-caster</i>: <q type="quote">καὶ ἀνέγειρέ μοι σαυτόν.</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn37"/> That the νεκυδαίμoνες could be thought to be simultaneously <q type="quote">restless</q> and <q type="quote">at rest</q> reflects their complex liminal status, and corresponds to the perception of magic as transgressive of natural boundaries. The rules of normal society simply did not apply to νεκυδαίμoνες, and this impacted the mode(s) of discourse which could be used to interact with them, just as the power of the Olympians demanded a certain degree of deference. This <q type="soCalled">arouse</q> command forms part of a series of commands and binding oaths targeted at the νεκυδαίμων by the <i>spell-caster</i>, which were apparently designed to ensure that the νεκυδαίμων completed the objective of the spell. Potentially, such concerns with restraining the νεκυδαίμων could be traced to archaic and early classical period Greek concerns with the uncontrolled <q type="quote">restless</q> dead, who might operate without supervision from a magical practitioner.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn38"/></p><p>      In order to impose effective limitations on the action of νεκυδαίμoνες, the <i>spell-caster</i> needed to establish him/her-self as more powerful than the spirit invoked by the spell. In <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.296-466, the <i>author</i>/<i>spell-caster</i> establishes a subordinate role for the νεκυδαίμων through a series of commands and invocations interspersed with his instructions concerning the<i>target</i> of the spell:</p><p>ὁρκίζω πάντας δαίμονας τοὺς ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ συνπαρασταθῆναι τῷ δαίμονι τούτῳ: καὶ ἀνέγειρέ μοι σαυτόν, ὅστις ποτ’ εἶ, εἴτε ἄρρην, εἴτε θῆλυς καὶ ὕπαγε… (345-348)</p><p>ὅτι σε ἐξορκίζω κατὰ τοῦ ὀνόματος τοῦ φοβεροῦ καὶ τρομεροῦ, οὗ ἡ γῆ ἀκούσασα τοῦ ὀνόματος ἀνοιγήσεται, οὗ οἱ δαίμονες ἀκούσαντες τοῦ ὀνόματος ἐνφόβου φοβηθήσονται, οὗ ποταμοὶ καὶ αἱ πέτραι ἀκούσαντες τὸ ὄνομα ῥήσσονται. ὁρκίζω σε, νεκύδαιμον, εἴτε ἄρρης, εἴτε θῆλυς, κατὰ τοῦ voces magicae μὴ μου παρακούσῃς, νεκύδαιμον, τῶν ἐντολῶν καὶ τῶν ὀνομὰτων, ἀλλ’ ἔγειρον μόνον σεαυτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς ἐχούσης σε ἀναπαύσεως, ὅστις ποτὲ εἶ, εἴτε ἄρρης, εἴτε θῆλυς καὶ ὕπαγε… (356-371)</p><p>ἐάν μοι τοῦτο τελέσῃς, ἀναπαύσω σε ταχέως: ἐγὼ γάρ εἰμι Βαρβαρ Ἀδωναί, ὁ τὰ ἄστρα κρύβων, ὁ λαμπροφεγγής οὐρανοῦ κρατῶν, ὁ κύριος κόσμου voces magicae (384-394)</p><p>ὅτι ὁρκίζω σε, νεκύδαιμον, κατὰ τοῦ φοβεροῦ, μεγάλου voces magicae (396-399)</p><p>The <i>spell-caster</i><q type="quote">binds</q> the νεκυδαίμων through the power of the invoked voces magicae to his/her service for the duration of the spell, and then <q type="quote">releases</q> the spirit at its successful conclusion. The first address to the νεκυδαίμων (345-348) effectively summons the spirit, the second (356-371) establishes the <i>spell-caster</i>’s control over the νεκυδαίμων through the use of extensive voces magicae, and the third (384-394) and fourth (396-399) function as reinforcements of the <i>spell-caster</i>'s power. The activated spells in <i type="title">Supplementum Magicum</i> 46-49 preserve almost identical formulaic language,<ptr type="footnote" target="fn39"/> while <i type="title">Supplementum Magicum</i> 50 displays a condensed version of the formula.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn40"/>  The <i>author</i> of <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.1496-1595 addresses <q type="quote">myrrh</q> with very similar patterns addressed.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn41"/> The arrangement of these adjurations, which are interlocked with the commands regarding the<i>target</i> of the spell, provides the foundation for understanding the logos of <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.296-466 as a cohesive magical utterance, whose mutually dependent elements influence and reinforce each other.</p><p>      The formulaic language – (ἐξ)ορκίζω σε, νεκύδαιμον, κατὰ (τοῦ ὀνόματος)… – used by the <i>spell-caster</i> to establish control over the νεκυδαίμων <q type="quote">first shows up in the Greek magical tradition in North Africa during the first century CE, presumably by way of Jewish rituals used to exorcize evil demons.</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn42"/> The application of this technique for controlling νεκυδαίμoνες, and other (semi-)divine powers, is attested by Lucian in the Φιλοψευδεὶς: <q type="quote">ὁ δὲ ὅρκους ἐπάγων, εἰ δὲ μὴ πεισθείη, καὶ ἀπειλῶν ἐξελαύνει, τὸν δαίμονα</q> (16.14-15).  The context, the <q type="quote">exorcism</q> of an apparent epileptic by an unnamed expert Syrian practitioner,<ptr type="footnote" target="fn43"/> may even demonstrate that the eastern influence on Greek demonology was recognized by some knowlegable<ptr type="footnote" target="fn44"/> Greeks. The invocations of voces magicae, interspersed with the names of known divinities, their epithets, and descriptions of their supremacy operate as displays of the power and effectiveness of the spell and its <i>author</i>, focalized through the actions and words of the <i>spell-caster</i>. The adjuration of νεκυδαίμoνες in erotic magic resembles the use of legalistic formulae in curse tablets, where the spirits are bound in the presence of chthonic deities such as Hermes, Hecate, and Peresphone.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn45"/> However, the binding oaths in the <i type="title">PGM</i> spells function as a form of <q type="quote">persuasive</q> magic directed by the <i>spell-caster</i> at the targeted νεκυδαίμων, and represent a <q type="quote">contract</q> between two unequal parties – essentially, the <i>spell-caster</i> does not permit the νεκυδαίμων to refuse the agreement.</p><p>      The most extreme examples of the <i>author</i>/<i>spell-caster</i> asserting his/her dominance over the νεκυδαίμων occur in those instances where the <i>spell-caster</i> assimilates him/her-self to the divine entities implicated by the voces magicae pronounced in the spell.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn46"/> This quasi-rhetorical device claims divine authority for the <i>spell-caster</i> and links him/her directly to the very gods and goddesses who normally have supremacy over the νεκυδαίμoνες. This appears to be a somewhat puzzling strategy, since the νεκυδαίμoνες could presumably differentiate between a human <i>spell-caster</i> and a god. Moreover, it was apparently used sparingly, since this formula is repeated only once in the <i type="title">Supplementum Magicum</i> spells which derive from <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.296-466.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn47"/> However, the repetitive nature of the commands and exhortations directed at the νεκυ-δαίμoνες may demonstrate that they were viewed as vulnerable, and not particularly intelligent, by Greek magical practioners;<ptr type="footnote" target="fn48"/> their marginal status rendered them susceptible to manipulation since they were isolated from the social structures of both the living and the dead, and hence had no external support in resisting this compulsion.</p><p>      In addition to the direct <q type="quote">ἐγὼ (γάρ) εἰμι voces magicae</q> formula found in the logos of <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.296-466, the <i>author</i>/<i>spell-caster</i> of <i type="title">PGM</i> LXI.1-38 orders the νεκυδαίμων to obey his commands <q type="quote">ὅτι περὶ ἐμὲ ἔχω τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ μεγάλου θεοῦ, οὗ οὐκ ἔξεστιν ὄνομα οὐδενὶ ὀνομάζειν, εἰ μὴ μόνῳ ἐμοὶ διὰ τὴν αὐτοῦ δύναμιν voces magicae</q> (23-25). This spell presents a more cautious claim: not directly assimilating the <i>spell-caster</i> to the god, but instead implying that the <i>spell-caster</i> has an exclusive relationship with the divinity based on secret magical knowledge. Although this is a subtle distinction, it may indicate that the <i>author</i>/ <i>spell-caster</i> employed a different approach to the divine power(s) invoked to control the νεκυδαίμων, or that he/she was working from a variant magical tradition.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn49"/> A final example combines an adaptation of the <q type="quote">ἐγὼ εἰμι</q> formula with a second aspect of the interaction between <i>spell-caster</i> and νεκυδαίμων, the common <q type="quote">μὴ μου παρακούσῃς</q> command. In <i type="title">PGM</i> CI.1-53, a particularly forceful agogē spell, the <i>spell-caster</i> orders the spirit, <q type="quote">Do not disobey me, but do [it] quickly, because ordering you is voces magicae</q> (23-28). This particular occurrence directly associates the <i>author</i>/<i>spell-caster</i>’s assimilation of divine power to the coercion of the νεκυδαίμων.</p><p>      Many <i type="title">PGM</i> spells which employ νεκυδαίμoνες include expressions which instruct or comment upon the obedience of the targeted spirit. This terminology establishes the <i>spell-caster</i>’s supremacy in relation to that νεκυδαίμων, and constructs an environment in which the <i>spell-caster</i>’s commands regarding the<i>target</i> of the spell will be successfully completed. In <i type="title">PGM</i> I.247-252, a brief invisibility spell, the <i>spell-caster</i> – after assimilating himself to Anubis, Osiris, and other voces magicae – instructs the νεκυδαίμων, <q type="quote">ὃ ἐὰν ἐπιτάζω ὑμῖν ἐγὼ ὁ δεῖνα, ὃπως ἐπήκοοί μοι γένησθε</q> (254-255).<ptr type="footnote" target="fn50"/> The generality of the command, even in the context of a single-purpose spell, emphasizes the desirability of the total obedience of the spirit. In <i type="title">PGM</i> IV. 2006-2125, a spell to summon a demon assistant, the summoned νεκυδαίμων actually tells the <i>spell-caster</i>, <q type="quote">ὁ θέλεις, ἐπίταξον, καὶ ποιῶ</q> (2054) in the context of a dream oracle. Another example occurs in the <q type="unclear">advertisement</q> for the second half of <i type="title">PGM</i> I.42-195. The <i>author</i> asserts that <q type="quote">ἐὰν ἐπιτάξῃς, παραυτὰ τὸ ἔργον ἐπιτελεῖ</q> (97-98).<ptr type="footnote" target="fn51"/> The emphasis on rapidity, as evidenced by the common tagline appended to many different types of spells,<ptr type="footnote" target="fn52"/> forms an undercurrent in Greek magical discourse. In reference to the instructions given to νεκυδαίμoνες, this prominence may also reflect the practitioner’s concern with controlling the spirit – the longer a νεκυδαίμων takes to discharge a spell, the greater likelihood that he will escape the <i>spell-caster</i>'s control. </p><p>      Other spells contain a more forceful version of this type of command: the <q type="quote">μὴ μου παρακούσῃς</q> formula,<ptr type="footnote" target="fn53"/> an implied threat closely associated with the <i>author</i>/<i>spell-caster</i>'s assumption of (divine) magical power. The primary meaning of παρακούω, <q type="quote">to hear accidentally or imperfectly,</q> emphasizes the importance of the spoken incantation for these spells, and further evidences that Greek magical practitioners conceived of νεκυδαίμoνες as at least partially capable of verbal communication. The injunction also implies that the νεκυδαίμoνες had the potential to ignore the <i>spell-caster</i>, and hence required persuasion or coercion to perform the action(s) required of them. In Lucian's Φιλοψευδεὶς, this verb depicts an elderly snake's resistance to magical compulsion: <q type="quote">μὴ δυνάμενος παρακούσας τοῦ προστάγματος</q> (12.21). Although framed as satire, the anecdote reflects the pre-occupation of Greek magical practitioners with exerting control over the νεκυδαίμoνες. In <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.296-466 and the related <i type="title">Supplementum Magicum</i> 46-50,<ptr type="footnote" target="fn54"/> the <q type="quote">μὴ μου παρακούσῃς</q> directive occurs directly after the central invocation of the <i>voces magicae</i>, which includes the reference to the unnamed <q type="quote">name of power.</q> The position of this injunction at the heart of the spell, and its association with an explicit reminder of the <i>spell-caster</i>’s superior magical power, reinforces the potency of the command. </p><p>      Other occurrences of this formula strengthen the coercion of the νεκυδαίμων through the use of direct intimidation: some threaten harm to the recalcitrant νεκυδαίμων, and others threaten the fabric of the universe itself. An example of the first type occurs in <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.2006-2125, <q type="quote">βραδύναντι δέ σοι κολάσεις ἐπενεγκῶ, ἃς οὐ δύνασαι ἐνεγκεῖν</q> (2096-2097).<ptr type="footnote" target="fn55"/> This type of threat attempts to ensure the spirit's cooperation through its self-interest and/or instinct for self-preservation. This implies that νεκυδαίμoνες were, to some degree, self-aware entities capable of perceiving pain or discomfort. The second type of threat operates in a more oblique manner: <q type="quote">ἐαν δὲ παρακούσητε καὶ μὴ ταχέως τελέσηται ὃ λέγω ὑμῖν, οὐ δύνετε ὁ ἥλιος ὑπὸ γῆν, οὔτε ὁ Ἅδης οὔτε ὁ κόσμος οὐκ ἔστιν… ἐὰν δὲ μοι μὴ τελέσητε ἃ λέγω ὑμῖν, κατακαύση ὑμᾶς ὁ Εωνεβυωθ</q> (Supp. Mag. 45.9-11, 14-15). The <i>author</i>/<i>spell-caster</i> attempts to control the νεκυδαίμων by threatening the order of the cosmos. Although magical operations at least partly depend on the inversion of natural forces, the degree of cosmic disturbance represented by this threat exceeds even normal magical discourse. A combination of the two types occurs in <i type="title">PGM</i> LXI.1-38: <q type="quote">ἦ διακόνησόν μοι πρὸς τὴν δεῖνα, πρίν σοι ἐπαναγκαστικοὺς θεοὺς ἐνέγκω, ἐὰν μὴ πέμψης, ἐπεὶ σιδηρᾶς θύρας ῥήξω αὐτός</q> (11-13). The deployment of <i>voces magicae</i> in the (ἐξ)ορκίζω formula, along with the implied (or explicit) collapse of the human practitioner’s power with the might of the gods apparently convinced the νεκυ-δαίμoνες that the <i>spell-caster</i> had the power to enforce the condition.</p><p>      In addition to threatening and coercive language, the <i>authors</i> (and <i>spell-caster</i>s) of the <i type="title">PGM</i> spells occasionally offered rewards to the νεκυδαίμoνες upon completion of their commands.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn56"/> In <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.296-466, the <i>spell-caster</i> offers to <q type="quote">release</q> the νεκυδαίμων after the <i>target</i> has been successfully attracted: <q type="quote">ἐάν μοι τοῦτο τελέσῃς, ἀναπαύσω σε ταχέως</q> (384).<ptr type="footnote" target="fn57"/> This formula is directly followed by the <q type="quote">ἐγὼ γάρ εἰμι</q> element, which acts as a reassurance to the νεκυδαίμων that the <i>spell-caster</i> has sufficient authority to fulfill his/her promise, as well as a not-so-subtle reminder of the consequences of disobedience. Three of the corresponding <i type="title">Supplementum Magicum</i> spells employ a similar dismissal phrase: <q type="quote">ἐάν τοῦτό μοι ποιήσῃς, ἀπολύσω σε</q> (46.27), <q type="quote">ἐάν τοῦτο ποιήσῃς, ἀπολύσω σε</q> (47.28), and <q type="quote">ἄμ μοι τοῦτο τελέσῃς, λύσω σε ταχέως. (50.71-72). The combination of reward and punishment provided a bi-partite motivation for the νεκυδαίμoνες, dependent on the <i>author</i>/<i>spell-caster</i>’s authoritarian role. Significantly, the release promised the νεκυδαίμων in <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.296-466 is apparently the same state it enjoyed prior to the activation of the spell: “ἔγειρον μόνον σεαυτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς ἐχούσης σε ἀναπαύσεως</q> (369-370).<ptr type="footnote" target="fn58"/> Contrary to modern assumptions about the release of an earth-bound spirit, the Greek <q type="quote">restless</q> dead were apparently content to remain in their liminal state, and none of the instances of this formula implies that the spirit will be sent down to Hades.</p><p>The two verbs employed in the dismissal formula, ἀναπαύω and ἀπολύω, have the general sense release.<ptr type="footnote" target="fn59"/> The use of ἀναπαύω employed in <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.296-466 appears to be nearly anomalous, as the other examples of this formula in <i type="title">PGM</i> generally employ ἀπολύω (see below). Sophpocles uses ἀναπαύω with the sense <q type="quote">to give rest (from wandering)</q> in <i type="title">Oedipus at Colonus</i>, <q type="quote">κἀναπαύσατον τὸν πρόσθ’ ἐρῆμον τοῦδε δυστήνου πλάνου</q> (1113-1114), and Demos-thenes employs the verb in <q type="quote">Against Phaenippus</q> to refer to release from civic involvement <q type="quote">λῃτουργοῦντας καὶ ἐν τοῖς τριακοσίοις ὄντας ἀναπαύειν</q> (42.25). The primary application of ἀπολύω, in contrast, involves acquittal in legal proceedings: <q type="quote">παῖδας δὲ αὐτοῦ ἀπαχ-θέντας Παυσανίης ἀπέλυσε τῆς αἰτίης.</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn60"/> Herodotus and Xenophon both employ ἀπολύω to refer to release from military service,<ptr type="footnote" target="fn61"/> and Thucydides applies the term to liberation from political domination: <q type="quote">οἱ μὲν τῆς ἀρχῆς ἀπολυθῆναι βουλόμενοι</q> (2.8). The most significant application of ἀπολύω occurs in Plato's <i type="title">Phaedo</i>, where he employs the term to the release of the soul from the body: <q type="quote">φιλόσοφος ἀπολύων ὅτι μάλιστα τὴν ψυχὴν ἀπὸ τῆς τοῦ σώματος κοινωνίας διαφερόντως τῶν ἄλλων ἀνθρώπων</q> (65a). Although framed in a philosophical dialogue, this passage explicitly connects ἀπολύω to matters involving the soul, often conflated with δαίμονες in later antiquity,<ptr type="footnote" target="fn62"/> and hints at the magical application of the term. The range of meanings inherent in these two verbs permits their application to a specialized magical function referring to the <q type="quote">release</q> of a νεκυδαίμων.</p><p>      The employment of ἀναπαύω and ἀπολύω in the context of the <i type="title">PGM</i> spells supports the interpretation of these verbs as technical idioms pertaining to the release of a νεκυδαίμων from the service of a <i>spell-caster</i>, especially in the context of spells which invoke a spirit as an assistant to the practitioner. In <i type="title">PGM</i> I.42-195, the <i>author</i> instructs the <i>spell-caster</i> to observe a particular libation when he releases the star/aerial daimōn/angel summoned for the purposes of an oracle: <q type="quote">ἐπὰν δὲ ἀπολύσῃς αὐτὸν, μετὰ τὸ ἀποστῆναι ἐπίθυε αὐτῷ τὰ προκείμενα καὶ σπένδε οἶνοι, καὶ οὓτως τῷ κραταιῷ ἀγγέλῳ φίλος ἔσει</q> (170-172). In <i type="title">PGM</i> II.64-183, the <i>spell-caster</i> is also instructed to release a divine entity also summoned for divination: <q type="quote">μαθὼν δὲ ἅπαντα ἀπολύσεις δοξοποιήσας ἀξίως ῥάνας αἵματι περιστερᾶς καὶ ἐπιθύσας ζμύρναν εἰπέ: ‘ἄπελθε, δέσποτα voces magicae</q> (176-178). <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.154-285 records two water divination spells which can summon both gods and νεκυδαίμoνες. At the conclusion of both praxeis, the <i>spell-caster</i> is instructed to release the spirit: <q type="quote">ἐὰν δὲ εἴπῃ, ἀπόλυε αὐτὸν τῇ ἀπο-λύσει</q> (232-233) and <q type="quote">ἐπὰν δὲ ἐκμάθῃς, ἀπόλυε τὸν θεὸν μόνον τῷ ἰσχυρῷ ὀνόματι τῷ τῶν ἑκατὸν γραμμάτων λέγων</q> (250-252). The first <i>praxis</i> in this spell appears to support the existence of a generalized dismissal formula, an ἀπόλυσις, perhaps with an attendant ritual that varied with the type of divinity or νεκυδαίμων. Each of these instances implies that the release of the summoned spirit is dependent on the fulfillment of the goal of the spell:<ptr type="footnote" target="fn63"/> the same conditional format evidenced in <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.296-466. In <i type="title">PGM</i> LXI.1-38, which displays several other anomalous traits, the <i>spell-caster</i> employs ἀπολύω to refer to the release of the νεκυδαίμων against the<i>target</i>: <q type="quote">ἀπολύω σε πρὸς τὴν δεῖνα, τὴν ἔτεκεν ἡ δεῖνα</q> (10). This apparent inversion of the formula may imply that the <i>spell-caster</i> intended the νεκυδαίμων to have a greater autonomy in the prosecution of this particular <i>agogē</i> spell, or conversely, the <i>author</i> of the spell may have confused or misunderstood the convention.</p><p>      The passages presented above illustrate some observations concerning the character, status, and function of νεκυδαίμoνες in the magical spells of Greco-Roman Egypt. Within the context of these practices, νεκυδαίμoνες filled the role of the servants of magical practitioners, bound by an asymmetrical conditional coercion. The exceptionally inferior status of the νεκυ-δαίμων, compared to the (exaggerated) magical power and proficiency of the <i>spell-caster</i>, compelled the spirit to accept the terms expounded in the <i>logos</i> of a given spell. Many of these interactions took the form of a double condition: if the νεκυδαίμων completed the demands of the <i>spell-caster</i>, it was released; if it failed to complete its orders, it was tortured. The violent domination of the νεκυδαίμoνες reflects a long-standing cultural apprehension concerning the spirits of the untimely dead,<ptr type="footnote" target="fn64"/> and forms a special mode of discourse appropriate to a magical setting. Other factors suggest that the <i type="title">PGM</i> authors viewed these spirits as capable of restricted communication with magical practitioners and cognizant of only a limited recollection of the complexities of human interactions. </p><p>      The <i type="title">PGM</i> spells portray the νεκυδαίμoνες as identifying only two social roles: master and servant. Although the language employed in these spells does not directly parallel the Greek idioms of slavery and manumission, the existence of a social relationship determined exclusively by power and defined in terms of binary opposition certainly reflects the social realities of a slave-owning community. Bagnall's observation <q type="quote">that though slaves provided much of life's comforts to the slave-owning class, they also posed much of its trouble and even danger,</q><ptr type="footnote" target="fn65"/> could apply equally to the problematic relationship between <i>spell-caster</i>s and the νεκυδαίμoνες they manipulated. Although the marginalized νεκυδαίμoνες were vulnerable to exploitation by Greek magical practitioners for precisely the same reasons that resulted in the enslavement of debtors and war captives, when left uncontrolled, their illicit nocturnal activities posed a serious threat to the structure of society. </p></div><div type="head_1"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The <i>epodē</i> of <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.1928-2005, a prayer addressed to Helios, contains the <i>spell-caster</i>'s authoritarian requirement that the νεκυδαίμων assistant he/she is summoning <q type="quote">μηδ’ ἀντία μοι φρονέοιτο</q> (1973). The close similarity between the sentiment of this statement and the expressions in <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.1429-1431, <i type="title">PGM</i> IV.1532-1533, <i type="title">PGM</i> LXI.23-25, <i type="title">PGM</i> CI.33, <i type="title">Supplementum Magicum</i> 45.51-52, and <i type="title">Supplementum Magicum</i>. 47.26 suggests that the </p><gap desc="figure"/><p><i>author</i>/<i>spell-caster</i> of these spells has transferred the necessity for absolute domination of the νεκυ-δαίμων into the description of the desired liaison between the<i>client</i> and<i>target</i> of the spell. The coercive dynamic between the <i>spell-caster</i> and the conjoured νεκυδαίμων, along with the associated violent discourse, permeates the magical language of Greek spells. This aggression transfers to erotic magic as a result of the νεκυδαίμων’s limited understanding of real human relationships. The <i>spell-caster</i> creates an analogical relationship between the<i>client</i> and<i>target</i> on the one hand and him/her-self and the νεκυδαίμων on the other, in order to to avoid confusing the νεκυδαίμων and maintain a consistent intensity in the <i>logos</i>. The <q type="soCalled">persuasive</q> use of violent language in Greek <i>defixiones</i> provides a foundation for understanding the brutality of erotic magic in terms of a magical, formulaic discourse designed to reinforce the hierarchical relationship between the <i>author</i>/<i>spell-caster</i> and the invoked νεκυδαίμων/νεκυδαίμονες.</p></div></div><div type="closer"><div type="bibliography"><head>Works Cited</head><listBibl><bibl>Bagnall, R.
