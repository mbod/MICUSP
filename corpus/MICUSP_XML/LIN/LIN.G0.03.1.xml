                        well-researched aspect of academic writing. As with any identifiable aspect
                        of academic writing, much of the research on hedging attempts to define it,
                        theoretically and functionally. Because of the negative treatment hedging
                        has received in the past, many studies (e.g. Skelton 1988a and 1988b; Myers
                        1996; Channell 1990; Banks 1998; Hyland 1994 and 1998) aim to validate the
                        presence and legitimacy of hedges in academic writing. Other research (e.g.
                        Hyland 1994 and 1998) has offered advice on how best to teach hedging in an
                        EAP context. Research has been undertaken on the pragmatics of hedging and
                        its link to politeness, its social implications, and how it affects the
                        negotiation of meaning between writer and reader (e.g. R. Lakoff 1972; Myers
                        1996; Salager-Meyer 1994). Several contrastive rhetoric studies have looked
                        at hedging in different cultures (eg Martìn-Martìn &amp; Burgess 2004)
                        and the possible linguistic transfer that may result from attempts to hedge
                        in the L2 (e.g. Clyne 1991; Hinkel 1997). Some attention has been paid to
                        the strength and presence of hedging and the variations thereof in certain
                        genres (such as the IMRD pattern for research papers) (Salager-Meyer 1994;
                        Martìn-Martìn &amp; Burgess 2004; Banks 1994b). However, one issue that
                        has not received as much attention in the literature as it perhaps warrants
                        is that of multiple hedging (using more than one hedge in a given statement,
                        such as in <q type="example">this may suggest...</q> or <q type="example">this could perhaps be…</q>). The fact that multiple hedging does indeed
                        occur is evident from a look at almost any piece of academic writing, and it
                        has not been entirely ignored in the research. Many studies mention it in
                        passing; however, few devote any significant amount of space or time to its
                        study. What this lack of focused attention leaves unclear is just how often
                        multiple hedging occurs, whether or not it is considered acceptable (and if
                        so how many hedges must be used before multiple hedging becomes
                        overhedging), and what, if any, factors, such as level of education, native
                        vs. non-native speaker status, etc, may affect the strength or amount of a
                        given writer’s use of hedges. In this paper, I will look specifically at
                        multiple hedging as a phenomenon of academic writing. I will start by
                        providing an extensive review of the literature on hedging, focusing first
                        on how hedging has been defined, and gathering from these different
                        definitions a working definition to apply to my own research; and focusing
                        secondly on how the notions of overhedging and underhedging have been
                        addressed in the literature, in order to see if multiple hedging has
                        received any sort of value judgment by the academic community. After this
                        literature review, I will turn to my own research: a look at multiple
                        hedging in the Hyland Corpus of academic text (which attempts to answer the
                        question of how often multiple hedging occurs) and a survey which attempts
                        to assess the evaluation of hedging expressions of various levels of
                        strength by different academic groups (this survey attempts to address the
                        acceptability of multiple hedging and the factors that may affect the
                        strength of a writer’s hedging expressions). I conclude by summarizing the
                        results of my research and exploring how these results may be useful to the
                        academic community.</p><div type="head_2"><head> II. A Survey of Definitions of Hedging in the Literature and an
                            Explanation of the Hedging Definition Used for the Present Research</head><p> George Lakoff introduced the term <i type="term">hedging</i> in 1972 as
                            a way to refer to <q type="quote">words whose job it is to make things
                                more or less fuzzy.</q> Lakoff’s introduction of the term did not
                            spark much research, however, and in 1988 the subject was still <q type="quote">scarcely touched on in ELT</q> (Skelton, 1988b, p. 98).
                            But since then, hedges have been written about relatively frequently in
                            the literature, with a significant amount of attention paid to both
                            hedges in speech and hedges in writing. Unsurprisingly, given the
                            slippery nature of pragmalinguistic phenomena in general, an agreed-upon
                            description of what linguistic devices count as hedges—and more
                            significantly what do not—does not emerge from the substantial
                            literature on this topic. What do exist are varied definitions of
                            hedging, which of course result in correspondingly varied taxonomies.
                            While the definitions given by most researchers are not always so
                            different as to be mutually exclusive, and while all the taxonomies
                            given have at least some corresponding items, it is nevertheless
                            necessary to clarify which (if any) researcher’s definition and taxonomy
                            I will be using and to justify why I have chosen it. I will not
                            necessarily be trying to construct the most sophisticated definition,
                            but rather to give the concept sufficiently clear boundaries so that it
                            can be operationalized in analytic practice. That is, I am by no means
                            trying to construct my own definition of hedging; I wish simply to find
                            a clear working definition to use for my research—research which, in
                            part, involves the location and identification of hedging devices in
                            academic text. </p><p> First, it is helpful to give an overview of how hedging has been looked
                            at in the literature and what controversies or disagreements exist when
                            it comes to finding a precise definition. George Lakoff’s (1972)
                            description of hedges, which, as I’ve mentioned, was the first to be
                            introduced in the field of linguistics, as <q type="quote">words whose
                                job it is to make things more or less fuzzy,</q> is—though of course
                            an important and useful one sparking years of research—itself
                            problematic. One problem lies with Lakoff’s use of the expression <q type="quote">more or less.</q> All other research has considered
                            hedges to be words which make things more fuzzy—not less fuzzy. Making
                            things less fuzzy is now thought to be a different linguistic concept,
                            with different pragmatic and linguistic properties; Hyland (eg 2004)
                            calls these items designed to make words less fuzzy <q type="quote">boosters.</q> If we disregard this part of Lakoff’s definition, we
                            are left thinking of hedges as words which make things more fuzzy. This
                            may appear to be a simple and straightforward definition on first
                            glance, but with a bit of thought it becomes clear that the word
                                <i>fuzzy</i> as it relates to hedging is, well, fuzzy. What is meant
                            by Lakoff’s little adjective and the linguistic phenomenon it attempts
                            to describe has been a hot topic of debate in the research literature on
                            hedging. </p><p> There is of course a certain level of correspondence in the research on
                            hedging: all authors seem to be in agreement that written hedges express
                            an attitude of uncertainty on the part of the author and/or a degree of
                            non-commitment to the truth of a given proposition. However, the
                            agreement stops with attempts at further, more precise definitions and
                            to an even larger extent with attempts to come up with a definitive
                            group of linguistic expressions to be considered as hedges. This can be
                            seen by a quick examination of some of the principal research. The
                            relatively early study by Prince et al. (1982) classifies hedges into
                            two different groups: <i type="term">approximators</i> which show
                            uncertainty/non-commitment <q type="quote">within the propositional
                                content proper</q> and <i type="term">shields</i>, which show
                            uncertainty/non-commitment <q type="quote">in the relationship between
                                the propositional content and the speaker</q> (p. 86). While Prince
                            et al. focus on spoken academic discourse, research in academic writing
                            discusses similar types of hedges (see for example Salager-Meyer 1994). </p><p> Skelton (1998b), who prefers to call hedges <q type="quote">comments</q>
                            (to avoid the <q type="quote">pejorative connotation</q> of the word <q type="term">hedge</q>), presents three categories into which
                            comments fall: Type one comments indicate tentativeness or levels of
                            probability and include copulas other than be; modal auxiliaries;
                            adjectivals and adverbials introduced by <i>It is</i>, <i>This is</i>,
                                <i>There is</i>, or which are sentence or clause-initial and
                            immediately followed by a comma; and lexical verbs. While Skelton
                            focuses by far the most attention on Type 1 comments, he also discusses
                            Type 2 comments which <q type="quote">are concerned with the way
                                adjectivals and adverbials in general function in academic text,</q>
                            and Type 3 comments, which deal with the <q type="quote">association
                                between commentative language and stylistic markedness</q> (p. 102). </p><p> In some contrast, a few authors focus on hedging’s pragmatic function
                            and its link to politeness, such as R. Lakoff (1972) and Myers (1989),
                            who argues that hedges are a social phenomenon and are perhaps best
                            understood as politeness strategies. Myers’s taxonomy includes modal
                            conditional verbs and modifiers and, perhaps a bit too broadly, <q type="quote">any device suggesting alternatives […] —anything but a
                                statement with a form of <q>to be</q> that such and such is the
                            case</q> (p. 13). Salager-Meyer (1994), who adopts a functional approach
                            in her attempt to define hedging, deals with the concept of modesty
                            (related to politeness) and believes that research on hedging should
                            give more emphasis to the fact that hedges are <q type="quote">the
                                product of a mental attitude</q> (p. 152). She adopts for her
                            research a definition that <q type="quote">goes beyond [...] mere
                                association with speculation</q> and entails <q type="quote">purposive fuzziness and vagueness (threat-minimizing strategy);
                                that which reflects the authors’ modesty for their achievements and
                                avoidance of personal involvement; and that related to the
                                impossibility or unwillingness of reaching absolute accuracy and of
                                quantifying all the phenomena under observation</q> (p. 153). Her
                            corresponding taxonomy includes five categories: shields, which include
                            modal verbs expressing possibility, <q type="quote">semi-auxiliaries</q>
                            (or copulas other than <i>be</i>), probability adverbs and adjectives,
                            and epistemic lexical verbs; approximators; words which <q type="quote">express the author’s personal doubt and direct involvement</q>;
                            emotionally charged intensifiers; and compound hedges (p. 154-155). </p><p> Hyland (1994, 1998) focuses on hedging’s link to epistemic modality,
                            defined by Lyons as <q type="quote">any utterance in which the speaker
                                explicitly qualifies his commitment to the truth of the proposition
                                expressed by the sentence he utters</q> (cited in Hyland 1994, p.
                            240). Hyland also acknowledges hedging’s social function saying that
                            it’s <q type="quote">a central means of gaining communal adherence to
                                knowledge claims</q> (p. 241). In other words, hedging is a way for
                            scholars to situate themselves within their discourse communities.
                            According to Hyland, hedging <q type="quote">reflect[s] a relation
                                between a writer and readers, not only the degree of probability of
                                a statement</q> (p. 241). Hyland’s taxonomy of hedging devices is
                            quite extensive (especially in Hyland 1998) and includes modal
                            auxiliaries, adjectival, adverbial, and nominal modal expressions, modal
                            lexical verbs, IF-clauses, question forms, passivization, impersonal
                            phrases, and time reference (1994, p. 240). Hyland (1994) also clarifies
                            that <q type="quote">Many instances of hedging take unpredictable forms,
                                for example by referring to the uncertain status of information, the
                                limitations of a model, or the absence of knowledge</q> (p. 243).
                            Hyland’s taxonomy, then, does not just include specific linguistic
                            forms, but a range of possible expressions. </p><p> Peter Crompton (1997), who believes that the lack of agreement among
                            researchers when it comes to precisely defining hedging as a linguistic
                            phenomenon is problematic, proposes a <q type="soCalled">narrower</q>
                            definition of hedging: <q type="quote">A hedge is an item of language
                                which a speaker uses to explicitly qualify his/her lack of
                                commitment to the truth of a proposition he/she utters</q> (p. 281).
                            In order to determine whether or not a given proposition involves the
                            use of hedging, Crompton proposes the following diagnostic question: <q type="quote">Can the proposition be restated in such a way that it
                                is not changed but that the author’s commitment to it is greater
                                than at present? If <q>yes,</q> then the proposition is hedged</q>
                            (p. 282). Crompton includes the following in his taxonomy of hedges:
                            copulas other than <i>be</i>, epistemic modals, clauses and adverbials
                            relating to the probability of the subsequent proposition being true, <q type="quote">reported propositions where the author(s) can be taken
                                to be responsible for any tentativeness in the verbal group, or
                                non-use of factive reporting verbs,</q> and <q type="quote">reported
                                proposition[s] that a hypothesized entity X exists and the author(s)
                                can be taken to be responsible for making the hypothesis</q> (p.
                            284). </p><p> Overall, we can see that, although the theoretical standpoint behind
                            each may vary to a certain extent, the fundamental base of these
                            researchers’ definitions of hedging is essentially the same: all involve
                            expressing degrees of uncertainty (I believe that both uncertainty used
                            intentionally as a way to avoid responsibility and uncertainty expressed
                            because more precise figures are unavailable require hedging devices,
                            though some researchers would disagree); and all the definitions I
                            examined give some attention to hedging’s pragmatic and/or social
                            functions. It is the terminology and the taxonomies of hedging
                            expressions which differ to such an extent that I must pick and choose
                            among them in order to do my own research. Because my work involves the
                            use of a corpus and, more specifically, searching for instances of
                            hedging within the corpus, it is helpful to come up with a list of which
                            linguistic expressions I will be considering in my search. In an attempt
                            to be as accurate as possible and to remain fairly neutral, I have
                            chosen to accept as hedges those linguistic items listed in Crompton
                            (1997) as discussed by two or more researchers (p. 280). These include
                            copulas other than <i>be</i>, certain lexical verbs used in certain
                            contexts, modal verbs, and probability adverbs and adjectives. It is
                            also necessary to define more specifically which modal verbs and lexical
                            verbs I will be using: I will consider only very <q type="soCalled">weak</q> lexical verbs (like <i type="example">suggest</i>), so that I
                            may be certain of their hedging content (for more discussion of this
                            issue see Johns 2001), and only modal verbs which express epistemic
                            uncertainty. Some further explanation is necessary here: One is able to
                            say that something <q type="quote">can be done</q>—meaning that it has
                            been done, or is factually able to be done; in this case <i>can</i> is
                            not a hedging device. On the other hand, one is able to say that
                            something <q>may be relevant,</q> in which case, may is expressing
                            epistemic uncertainty on the part of the speaker and is therefore a
                            hedging device. The same distinction applies to probability adverbs and
                            adjectives: the expression <q>possible to</q> cannot be used to hedge,
                            as it expresses factual ability; the expression <q>possible that</q> can
                            be used to hedge, as it has epistemic content. </p><p> In addition to these more or less agreed upon linguistic categories, I
                            will include several other items. The first of these is approximators,
                            as described by Salager-Meyer (1994). I do so because, although Crompton
                            claims Salager-Meyer is the only author to include this item in her
                            taxonomy of hedging, many of the articles I’ve looked at (specifically
                            those on vagueness in academic writing) also considered approximators as
                            hedges. Also, approximators fit with the basic theoretical standpoint
                            I’m adopting: the relatively agreed-upon idea that hedging is used to
                            express degrees of (avoidable or non-avoidable) uncertainty. Next, I
                            will include items which are semantically related to (but belong to a
                            different word class than) the lexical verbs I consider as hedges (eg:
                                <i>implication, suggestion</i>, etc). Crompton states that Hyland is
                            the only researcher to do so, but I see no reason why I should not
                            include these related words, as they have the same semantic content as
                            the lexical verbs (and it is the semantic content of a word that creates
                            a hedged effect, not that word’s part of speech). Using the same
                            reasoning, I will include words related to the copulas other than
                            <i>be</i> (such as <i>appearance</i> and <i>seemingly</i>) and nouns of
                                <i>probability</i>, when appropriate (such as possibility when
                            clearly used in an epistemic sense). I will not include any other items
                            mentioned by only one researcher, such as IF-clauses (Hyland, 1994,
                            1998) and <q type="quote">expressions of the authors’ personal doubt and
                                direct involvement</q> (Salager-Meyer, 1994).</p><p> I would also like to point out that I believe Crompton (1997) is correct
                            when he says that <q type="quote">to count all uses of certain
                                linguistic tokens as hedges, is to run the risk of misrepresenting
                                the discourse</q> (p. 279). For this reason, I will attempt to
                            consider not only the lexical items I take to be hedges, but their
                            placement and meaning within their respective propositions, in order to
                            verify that these expressions are indeed being used as hedges. By doing
                            this, I hope to avoid some of the <q type="quote">misrepresent[ation of]
                                the discourse</q> that Crompton speaks of. I of course acknowledge
                            that introspection is not always a reliable form of data analysis, and
                            is quite difficult when working with the large amount of data yielded by
                            corpus research (especially research using Hyland’s sizeable corpus of
                            240 academic research articles) but I believe it is better than somewhat
                            blindly considering only surface forms without taking into account any
                            of their semantic context. </p><p> The hedging categories, with some obvious linguistic realizations, are
                            therefore as follows:</p><p> Copula verbs (and semantically related parts of speech) →<i>seem,
                                appear, seemingly</i></p><p> Modal verbs → <i>may, might</i></p><p> Weak lexical verbs (and semantically related parts of speech →
                                <i>suggest, suggestion</i></p><p> Probability adverbs, adjectives, and nouns → <i>possibly, possible,
                                possibility</i></p><p> Approximators → <i>some, relatively</i></p><p>From here, I will move on to a discussion of how multiple hedging has
                            been looked at in the literature and how these explorations by other
                            researchers relate to the current research.</p></div></div><div type="head_1"><head> III. Underhedging, Overhedging and Multiple hedging: Background and
                        Treatment in Research Literature and EAP Textbooks</head><p> Views on hedging as a phenomenon of academic writing have undergone a
                        dramatic shift within the past 15 to 20 years. Skelton (1988b) shows that at
                        the point in time of his article, hedges were quite strongly looked down
                        upon, the term <i type="term">hedging</i> carrying <q type="quote">unfortunately pejorative connotations in ordinary language</q> (p. 98).
                        In fact, the idea that hedges should be used—not avoided—is presented by
                        Skelton as an almost radical idea. (Today, at least among academic
                        researchers <q>in the know,</q> this idea is accepted without question,
                        perhaps even taken for granted.) Over time, more and more articles
                        justifying the legitimacy of hedging in academic writing have been published
                        and today the term <i type="term">hedging</i> does not carry as strong of a
                            <q type="soCalled">pejorative connotation.</q> Unfortunately, all is not
                        as well as it should be. To this day, many style guides still advise
                        strongly against hedging; the widely used Strunk and White (1979), for
                        example, calls qualifiers (another words for hedges) <q type="quote">the
                            leeches that infest the pond of prose, sucking the blood of words</q>
                        (p. 73). This comment could perhaps be appropriate in talking about business
                        or technical writing, which aims for clarity, precision, and conciseness,
                        but it hardly seems appropriate for academic genres, where hedges often have
                        an essential role (for more examples of this inappropriate type of negative
                        treatment, see Hyland 1994 and 1998). And, according to Hyland, at least as
                        of 1998, many ESP/EAP textbooks have failed to give an adequate amount of
                        attention to hedging (see Hyland 1994 and 1998). If our view of what
                        constitutes good academic writing are based on authentic texts and the
                        discourse practices involved with those texts rather than prescriptive rules
                        determined by some (often unknown or unnamed) authority’s idealized version
                        of a language (and I quite think they should be), then we cannot ignore or
                        deny the legitimacy of hedging’s presence, whether in speech or writing.
                        Indeed, the importance of hedging has been demonstrated, with increasing
                        frequency over the last 20 years or so. The most extensive of these works
                        devoted to demonstrating the validity of hedging and to defining some of its
                        characteristics is Ken Hyland’s book <i type="title">Hedging in Scientific
                            Research Articles</i> (1998). Other works include Banks (1998), Myers
                        (1996), Hyland (1994), Skelton (1988a), and the previously mentioned Skelton
                        (1988b).</p><p> It will be useful at this point to see where multiple hedging fits in
                        through a further examination of some of the justifications of hedging
                        provided in the literature. Hyland (1994) focuses on arguing that the strong
                        presence of hedging in academic writing requires an equivalently strong
                        amount of attention in EAP textbooks—an amount of attention which, in
                        Hyland’s view, is rarely found. By this point in time, hedging has found its
                        place in the research literature, but according to Hyland, not much has been
                        done to place the research done into practice. Hyland stresses that teaching
                        materials should be revised to place an appropriate amount of emphasis on
                        hedging. In his view, the problem students face is that they underhedge; he
                        does not mention overhedging as a potential problem. One might feel here
                        that Hyland is perhaps overstating the need for focus on hedging in EAP
                        textbooks. While hedging does occur very frequently and should, of course,
                        be given some attention in any well-developed set of language teaching
                        materials, it is possible that hedging does not receive more focus because
                        it is not extraordinarily difficult for students to accomplish some base
                        level of hedging, like the use of modal and lexical verbs, for example. It’s
                        likely that a relatively short amount of coverage would suffice. This does
                        not take away, however, from Hyland’s point that the negative attitude
                        towards hedging readily encountered in the past is problematic and that EAP
                        materials should work to counter any negative associations with this useful
                        phenomenon. Also, his point that a lack of attention may lead to
                        underhedging is potentially valid and should be taken into consideration.</p><p> Other justifications are provided by authors’ work on vagueness (which is
                        not quite the same as hedging, though definitely related, as it can be used
                        to moderate levels of certainty). David Banks (1998) writes about the
                        importance of vagueness, focusing on quantification in scientific journal
                        articles. Here, the focus is on dispelling the myth that scientific writing
                        should strive for total objectivity and should avoid vagueness. According to
                        Banks, a certain level of vagueness is not only acceptable in scientific
                        discourse, it is necessary. He implies that previous assumptions which do
                        not consider vagueness as an essential part of scientific writing should be
                        reconfigured, stating that <q type="quote">it is of upmost importance that
                            we do not allow our understanding of vague quantification in the
                            scientific journal article to remain vague</q> (p. 26). He does not,
                        however, mention the use of multiple expressions of vagueness or being
                        overly vague.</p><p> Myers (1996) also discusses the legitimacy of vagueness, arguing that
                        vagueness can be used strategically in academic writing. Instead of teachers
                        telling students and editors telling authors that vagueness is to be avoided
                        at all costs, an attempt should be made to understand how vagueness can work
                        as a useful technique that extends the scope of a text through time and
                        space, thus giving the writer a larger role in the reader’s interpretation.
                        Myers points out that there is such a thing as being too vague, but it’s
                        difficult to pin down. As he says <q type="quote">Vagueness is appropriate
                            in some contexts, but writers have to understand how and why they are
                            using it.</q> (p. 12) He claims that people, especially teachers, need
                        to take time to better define the notion of vagueness, allowing room for its
                        intentional and appropriate use: <q type="quote">The question to ask in
                            teaching is not whether an expression is vague but: For whom is it
                            vague? Vague as opposed to what other expression? To what end is it
                            vague?</q> (p. 12). </p><p> Channell (1990) also argues in favor of vagueness, saying that <q type="quote">the view that the precision of science and scientific
                            language depends upon the precision of its terms is certainly very
                            plausible, but it is none the less, I believe, a mere prejudice</q> (p.
                        95). While she does not specifically deal with multiple hedging, or
                        over/underhedging, Channell stresses the need for a clear understanding of
                        using vagueness appropriately to be imparted to students: <q type="quote">Clearly, prospective writers […] need to develop a […] sensitivity to
                            the conventions relating to precision versus vagueness</q> (p. 117). In
                        her view, what is most important is emphasizing to students that <q type="quote">vagueness <i>is</i> appropriate in certain
                        circumstances</q> (p. 117). </p><p> It seems that these articles, especially Hyland (1994) and Banks (1998), are
                        so intent on arguing against the contention that hedging is to be avoided
                        (an understandable position since, as we have seen, hedging still needs a
                        lot of arguing for) that overhedging isn't really mentioned. John Skelton
                        (1988a), who suggests that hedges should be broken down into two distinct
                        classes, comments and propositions, also argues for the general importance
                        of hedging to academic discourse. However, unlike the previously discussed
                        authors, Skelton is quick to point out that, although a lack of sufficient
                        attention given to hedging can certainly lead to underhedging, it may, just
                        as importantly, lead to overhedging as well. Undergraduate students in the
                        sciences may underhedge because they are told to be <q type="quote">objective and propositional,</q> resulting in overconfident-sounding
                        claims like <q type="quote">The jump in the reading was enormous and a great
                            surprise</q> (p. 40). On the other end of the spectrum, the <q type="quote">contract of inexactitude</q> that hedges (or for Skelton <q type="quote">comments</q>) attempt to create between writer and reader
                        can fail to be upheld by a writer who presents a large number of comments in
                        a given chunk of text. He cites the following example from the textbook <i type="title">Reading and Thinking in English</i> (British Council 1980): </p><p><q type="quote">Before we consider what mechanisms could possibly underlie
                            the metal-bending effect, we must first help ourselves by starting with
                            a brief summary of what it is that we shall have to try to explain. The
                            multitude of the accounts make it clear that we are dealing with a
                            genuine effect which can happen sometimes as a result of direct contact
                            with a subject, and sometimes without it. The main action in the case of
                            direct contact appears to be that of gentle stoking by the fingers of
                            one hand. The length of time taken to cause an appreciable bend seems to
                            vary, but it is normally less than thirty minutes and more than two or
                            three; moreover, for a particular subject it can vary considerably from
                            one day to the next.</q> (cited in Skelton 1988a, p. 40). </p><p>It’s interesting to note here that not only are a large number of hedging
                        expressions used, but the presentation of the data is also quite
                        inconclusive and unhelpful. One can also see that the writer uses hedging
                        devices when they are not at all necessary, for instance by saying that the
                        length of time <q type="quote">seems to vary</q> and then giving direct
                        evidence that it does indeed vary. Skelton clarifies that this overhedging
                        is not as apparent or as off-putting to the reader as underhedging but is
                        still problematic as it will tend to give the reader the impression that the
                        writing is too vague. Skelton cites a <q type="quote">typical student
                            response</q> to the previously quoted passage: <q type="quote">It’s all
                            up in the air, no facts, real…it’s all maybe this, maybe that, he never
                            gets down to it. It’s just vague</q> (p. 41). As far as how much and
                        what kinds of uncertainty are acceptable/appropriate, Skelton can only say
                        that it is an area needing future research. </p><p> While the previously discussed articles have suggested that the lack of
                        sufficient attention given to hedging in English style guides and EAP
                        textbooks (and the assumption that scientific prose should be completely
                        objective) mainly leads to underhedging, various contrastive rhetoric based
                        studies (eg Clyne, 1991; Hinkel, 1997) suggest that NNSs writing in English
                        have a tendency to hedge more than NS writers and that this may create an
                        impression of excessive indirectness for NS readers. Clyne (1991), for
                        example, shows that German-speaking scholars hedge more when writing in
                        English than do English-speaking scholars. He claims that this is likely due
                        to both the strong presence of hedging in German and a lack of comfort when
                        writing in a foreign language. According to Clyne, the abundance of hedges
                        in German authors’ written English is not wrong, per se, but it can be
                        problematic, for German-speaking author and English-speaking reader, because
                        it does not meet the <q type="quote">expectations of discourse</q> of
                        academic written English. (Whether or not NNSs <i>should</i> be expected to
                        conform to the discourse expectations of academic written English is another
                        issue—undoubtedly important, but beyond the scope of this paper). </p><p> Hinkel (1997) also provides evidence supporting the idea that NNSs L1
                        hedging habits may interfere with their use of hedges in English. Her
                        article posits that NSs and NNSs use different types of hedges at different
                        rates, so that, while NNs use possibility hedges more than NNSs, and hedged
                        performative verbs are used at the same rate by both groups, performative,
                        lexical, and quality hedges are used more by NNSs. Hinkel seems to be in
                        agreement with the consensus in saying that <q type="quote">what represents
                            appropriate levels of indirectness in written and academic discourse is
                            not always clear,</q> (p. 363) also mentioning that <q type="quote">when
                            students are instructed that English writing is expected to be direct,
                            they often produce expository pieces so open and frank that they can be
                            perceived as inappropriate</q> (p. 363). Hinkel’s research highlights
                        the bind that many NNSs writing in English doubtless find themselves in: on
                        the one hand, the hedging practices for NNSs whose native languages are
                        indirect and vague may influence these writers to transfer these qualities
                        onto their English prose, resulting in a piece that might strike the reader
                        as overhedged; on the other hand, these same students may underhedge because
                        of attempts to change made by teachers to lessen the degree of these
                        students’ indirectness—that is, precisely because they are told not to
                        overhedge. </p><p> Level of education may also have an effect on strength and frequency of
                        hedging, though there is no conclusive evidence. Shaw (2000) for example
                        discusses a group of dissertation writers who tended to hedge claims that
                        were already hedged (in other words, to use multiple hedges). For example,
                        Shaw points out that the dissertation writers may be more likely to use
                        phrases such as <q type="quote">suggesting that X may be Y</q> rather than
                            <q type="quote">suggesting that X is Y</q> (p. 52). Although Shaw does
                        not explicitly say so, this is perhaps worth remarking on because it may
                        indicate that writers at different levels in their education may hedge with
                        a different level of strength and frequency. In this case, the dissertation
                        writers may be hedging more than their colleagues who have already attained
                        a PhD. But Shaw doesn’t say whether or not more experienced writers have the
                        same tendency to add more hedges to already hedged claims, so it is
                        difficult to tell if this is significant. It is also interesting to note
                        here that, as mentioned above, Skelton (1988a) shows that undergraduate
                        students in the sciences may tend to make overconfident-sounding claims.
                        Suggestions have been made, then, though it remains to be seen how valid
                        they are, that lower standing on the academic totem-pole can result in both
                        underhedging and multiple/stronger levels of hedging (perhaps overhedging as
                        well, though the hedging that Shaw discusses is not talked of as
                        problematic). But again, one cannot draw conclusive claims from this
                        somewhat sparse evidence.</p><p> The situation seems quite problematic, thus, for NNSs writing academic
                        English and/or for inexperienced writers of academic English: on the one
                        hand these not-yet-expert (but, for the most part, not-quite-novice) writers
                        are expected to express uncertainty appropriately, without seeming
                        overconfident or unable to see the validity of opposing evidence; on the
                        other, they are expected to do so without going overboard and hedging all of
                        their claims into obscurity. Exactly where this narrow margin of correct
                        amount/intensity of hedging is found is difficult to determine. In fact, it
                        seems that not even experienced linguists and discourse analysts seem to be
                        able to pin it down precisely--let alone relatively inexperienced writers
                        (this is not a fault on the part of the experts: language itself does not
                        take very well to matters of precision). In other words, the level of
                        uncertainty a writer should adopt towards his or her expressions is just
                        that: uncertain. </p><p> Some authors have attempted to delve into this subject by looking directly
                        at levels of uncertainty in academic text. Françoise Salager-Meyer (1994)
                        devotes some attention to the level of hedging considered acceptable in
                        academic discourse (more specifically medical discourse, though her results
                        can most likely be generalized, at least to other disciplines with a
                        tendency to follow the IMRD pattern for writing research papers), claiming
                        that <q type="quote">the choice of expression of tentativeness and
                            flexibility is dictated by the general structure of the discourse</q>
                        (p. 149). In other words, the level of acceptable hedging depends on the
                        area of the paper and the type of publication. The results of her study
                        indicate that the Discussion section is the most heavily hedged section of a
                        paper and the Introduction section second most heavily hedged (the Methods
                        and Results section tend to use much less hedging). She also discusses
                        multiple hedging, which she refers to as <q type="quote">compound
                        hedges.</q> Though she does not explicitly discuss the question of whether
                        or not compound hedges are acceptable, her treatment of the subject
                        indicates that she believes they are (they are certainly used in the
                        research papers and case reports that she uses for her study). In fact, she
                        considers compound hedges as a category of hedging, that is as a type of
                        hedge, and places them alongside other types of hedges (such as shields,
                        approximators, and emotionally-charged intensifiers). Why she chooses to
                        define these compound hedges as a separate category of hedging, despite the
                        fact that compound hedges are made up of other categories, like shields and
                        approximators, and have no distinguishing semantic features of their own, is
                        unclear. Compound hedges follow the general trend she establishes, occurring
                        most frequently in the Discussion section, relatively frequently in the
                        Introduction section, and not very frequently in the Methods and Results
                        sections. The reason for the strong presence of compound hedges in the
                        Discussion section is, according to Salager-Meyer, due to the fact that, <q type="quote">It is in this last section of research papers that writers
                            speculate, argue, contrast, and extrapolate from the described results,
                            and at the same time avoid stating results too conclusively</q>(p. 163).
                        The stronger need to demonstrate levels of uncertainty which occurs in the
                        Discussion section calls for a greater amount of hedges. A strong level of
                        uncertainty, thus, seems to be acceptable and even expected in research
                        papers, but, Salager-Meyer points out, popularization articles and
                        texts-books are expected to avoid any strong levels of hedging (she cites an
                        example: <q type="quote"><q>this suggests the possibility</q> is replaced by <q type="quote">they
                                discovered</q></q> (p. 165)). Evidence supporting Salager-Meyer’s proposal that the
                        strongest and most frequent use of hedging appears in the Introduction and
                        Conclusion/Discussion section is also validated by research done
                        Martìn-Martìn and Burgess (2004) in their study on academic criticism in
                        research article abstracts and by David Banks’s (1994b) book chapter <q type="title">Some Hedges.</q></p><p> In addition to Skelton (1988a) and Salager-Meyer (1994), several other
                        researchers have dealt directly with multiple hedging. Clyne (1991), for
                        example, directly focuses on multiple hedging, which he refers to most often
                        as <q type="quote">double hedging</q> (also mentioning <q type="quote">triple hedging</q> once or twice). Clyne looks at the use of hedging in
                        a corpus of 52 texts, a compilation of English texts written by both
                        English-speaking and German-speaking authors and of German texts by Germans.
                        As mentioned previously, the German-speaking authors hedge more than the
                        English-speaking authors, both when writing in English and when writing in
                        German, and this trend is the same for the use of multiple hedges. In fact,
                        the results of Clyne’s data indicate that the use of multiple hedging is a
                        great deal lower for English-speaking authors. This is surprising, seeing
                        as, for example, multiple hedges occurred so frequently in Salager-Meyer’s
                        (1994) study that she designated them as a distinct category of hedges and
                        that David Banks (1994a and 1994b), as will be discussed in more detail
                        later, sees double hedges so frequently that he is able to determine their
                        collocation patterns—certainly such an uncommon phenomenon as Clyne makes
                        double hedging out to be wouldn’t have its own set of collocations . One
                        might guess that the large difference between use of hedging for
                        German-speaking and English-speaking scholars results from extremely large
                        amounts of hedges in German authors’ work, but this is not the case,
                        according to Clyne; hedging devices in texts by English speakers occurred an
                        average of only 6.25 times (with the German authors’ texts at a much higher
                        average of 24 instances). Clyne does not clarify what percentage of the
                        texts is made up of hedges, but as he is examining published works,
                        including articles and conference papers, it is reasonable to assume that
                        the percentage rate of hedging expressions for English-speaking authors
                        would come out to be quite low, especially in comparison to the percentages
                        given elsewhere: Salager-Meyer (1994) gave hedging expressions an occurrence
                        rate of 13% <q type="quote">with respect to the total number of running
                            words in each division</q> for the Discussion section of research papers
                        (p. 155-157). Clyne also claims that multiple hedges of greater than two
                        hedging expressions (<q type="quote">triple hedges</q>, etc) were completely
                        absent from the texts by English speakers, though not from the texts by
                        German speakers, which is a bit difficult to believe and, if true, is
                        probably a result of the small size of the corpus. Hyland’s large corpus
                        corpus of 240 research articles provides a significant number of triple
                        hedges, such as <q type="quote">This might seem to help explain why it is
                            that (2) is true but (2*) is not</q> and <q type="quote">While teachers
                            might be able to suggest a number of strategies that students may find
                            helpful…</q> (depending on one’s definition of hedging, these examples
                        could contain even more than three hedges). However, while Clyne’s figures
                        on hedging in the texts of English speakers may be a bit hard to accept
                        (given the conflicting results of other studies), his point that German
                        speakers hedge more frequently and more strongly than English speakers is
                        well-taken. We have already seen that hedging may not be adequately
                        explained to non-native English speakers, so it is completely understandable
                        that German authors attempt to transfer their knowledge of hedging in German
                        (which is strong and frequent, according to Clyne) into English, and perhaps
                        in doing so they end up overhedging their claims. The idea of linguistic
                        transfer leading to overhedging (or at least a greater occurrence of
                        multiple hedges) is also demonstrated by Hinkel (1997), as discussed
                        previously. </p><p> Perhaps the most direct address of multiple hedges occurs in David Banks’
                        (1994b) book <i type="title">Writ in Water: Aspects of the Scientific
                            Journal Article</i> and in his article <q type="title">Hedges and How to
                            Trim Them</q> (1994a). Chapter 8 of Banks (1994b), <q type="title">Some
                            Hedges</q> discusses certain multiple-hedge collocations that may be
                        noted. (These collocations are also discussed in Banks 1994a). Banks lists
                        the following a typical combinations of hedging devices: lexical verbs
                        linked to modal auxiliaries by the use of the modal in a subordinate clause
                        following the lexical verb; a lexical verb and an adverb; a verb plus
                        complement reinforcement; a modal auxiliary and an adverb; a periphrastic
                        modal and an adverb; a complex noun group; and, most commonly, a lexical
                        verb with hedging content combined with a modal auxiliary. In <q type="title">Hedges and How to Trim Them</q> (1994), the results of
                        Banks’s corpus study of eleven scientific articles results in <q type="quote">58 sentences which possess more than one hedging device</q>
                        (p. 587). He calls these multiple hedges <q type="quote">fertilized.</q> He
                        also speaks of <q type="quote">trimmed</q> hedges, which are de-emphasized
                        hedges or combinations of hedges and <q type="soCalled">boosters</q> (as
                        defined in Hyland 2004). According to his research, fertilized hedges are
                        much more common and occur in many more varieties than do trimmed hedges. He
                        sums up by saying <q type="quote">A hedged style has become a requirement of
                            scientific journals</q> (591). One can assume that Banks’ descriptive
                        study of multiple-hedge collocations carries with it the implication that
                        using double hedges is perfectly acceptable, and this last citation seems to
                        affirm the idea. Indeed, most of the research examined here which mentions
                        double or multiple hedging in one way or another (except that done by Clyne)
                        carries a similar implication; however, neither Banks nor any of the other
                        researchers make any judgment as to how much hedging is acceptable in a
                        given proposition. </p><p> Now that we have considered the treatment of multiple hedging in the
                        research literature, let us move to a brief overview of some textbooks used
                        for teaching academic writing, which will not only give examples of the
                        different extents to which hedging is covered in textbooks (which is
                        explained in much more detail by Hyland 1994) but will also give an
                        indication of whether or not textbooks devote time or focus to multiple
                        hedging and the question of its acceptability or to underhedging and
                        overhedging as potential problem areas for students. <i type="title">Writing
                            in the Sciences</i> (1998) gives a comparatively large amount of
                        attention to hedges which it refers to as <q type="quote">qualifiers.</q>
                        The book places emphasis on the importance of careful conclusions and
                        acknowledging uncertainty giving examples of verbs, adverbs and adverbial
                        phrases, and modal auxiliaries which can be used for this purpose and
                        providing several practice exercises. It mentions underhedging as a problem
                        but not overhedging. There is also no mention of multiple hedging mentioned.</p><p> Another text, <i type="title">Responses to ESP</i> (1997), does briefly
                        mention hedging, though it does not give as much attention to the phenomenon
                        as does <i type="title">Writing in the Sciences</i>. In the section <q type="title">Some features of scientific English</q> Alastair Sharp
                        provides a list of <q type="quote">some of the features generally recognized
                            as being important in scientific discourse</q> one of which is modals.
                        Modals are mentioned as essential for hedging (which is very briefly
                        explained as <q type="quote">the modification of language to limit the
                            strength of a knowledge claim</q>) but there is no mention of other
                        types of hedges. A short exercise is given, but there is no mention of
                        underhedging or overhedging. </p><p> Perhaps the best overall coverage of hedging that I found occurs in <i type="title">Academic Writing for Graduate Students</i> by Swales and
                        Feak (2004). Unit 4 of the book, which focuses on data commentary, has a
                        section explaining qualification and strength of claim (which includes
                        hedging devices, though the term <i type="term">hedging</i> is not directly
                        used). The book clarifies that it is problematic to describe rather than
                        comment, but it is also problematic to <q type="quote">draw unjustified
                            conclusions,</q> and therefore it is important to find the right
                        strength of claim, to be cautious in expressing a claim, and to know what
                        expressions to use. Words which can be used to express probability,
                        distance, and generalization are given and discussed, and there is also a
                        section on <q type="quote">weaker verbs</q> (examples are given). The book
                        also mentions that these expressions can be combined (multiple hedging)—that
                        is, multiple hedging is an acceptable and useful strategy—but it should not
                        be overdone, or no claim will be made at all, as in <q type="quote">It could
                            be concluded that some evidence seems to suggest that at least certain
                            villagers might not have traded their pottery with others outside the
                            community</q> (p.129). It is the only textbook of those that I’ve
                        examined which mentions multiple hedging (as an acceptable strategy) and
                        discusses both overhedging and underhedging. </p><p> But again the question arises: where do we draw the line between being <q type="quote">confidently uncertain</q> (Skelton 1988b, cited in Swales
                        and Feak) and overdoing it? So far, we have examined the treatment of
                        multiple hedging and its link to overhedging and underhedging in research
                        literature and EAP textbooks, yet we have found no concrete answers to these
                        questions. This brings me at last to my research, which attempts to provide
                        some sort of answer to this question of how often multiple hedging is done
                        and to examine the judgments of different groups within the academic world
                        on how seldom or frequently hedging should occur. To get an idea of how
                        often multiple hedging is done, I’ve looked at select expressions in the
                        Hyland Corpus, which contains 240 research articles coming from 8 different
                        academic fields. To get an idea of the level of hedging people consider
                        appropriate and to see if level of education or native/non-native speaker
                        distinction affects attitudes towards hedging (and, one can assume,
                        therefore use of hedging) I’ve conducted a survey of 3 different academic
                        groups at the University of Michigan: teachers of academic writing, NS
                        undergraduate students, and NNS graduate students. It is now appropriate to
                        explain these in more detail and provide the results of my research. </p></div><div type="head_1"><head> IV. Methods, Results, and Analysis</head><p> To get an idea of the frequency with which multiple hedging occurs, I turned
                        to the Hyland Corpus. Since examining every proposition of each of the 240
                        articles in the corpus for the presence of hedging devices is not a
                        realistic goal, it was necessary for me to choose certain expressions and
                        examine their overall frequency and the presence of hedging expressions in
                        their immediate context using the Wordsmith concordance feature. First, in
                        order to get an indication of how frequently hedged expressions occur in the
                        environment of at least one other hedge, I examined the modal verb
                        <i>might</i> and the probability adverb <i>perhaps</i>. I chose these two
                        expressions because, unlike some of their counterparts, they are almost
                        always used as hedges and thus should give a good starting ground to the
                        present research. The results follow. A Wordsmith search yielded a total of
                        868 entries for the word <i>might</i>. I examined these 868 and deleted the
                        irrelevant entries: there are some transcripts of speech in the corpus,
                        which I chose not to include in my analysis as I am attempting to focus on
                        academic writing; there a number of instances in which the given hedging
                        expression occurs within a citation (I chose not to include these in my
                        analysis because they don’t really contribute to the overall strength of
                        hedging in the claim); and finally, it seems that a Wordsmith search turns
                        up a few repeated examples, which I tried to be aware of and exclude. After
                        deleting these entries I was left with 810 examples, of which I examined the
                        surrounding context (attempting to read at least the sentence the word
                        occurred in), searching for other hedging expressions. My criteria as to
                        what linguistic devices I included as hedges are defined earlier in the
                        paper. It is also worth mentioning at this point that, although there has
                        been some suggestion that hedging devices can carry over from one expression
                        to another (Skelton 1988b), to avoid inflating the results of my data, I
                        included only those hedges which fell in the same sentence as the word
                            <i>might</i>. I was able to find another expression of hedging in the
                        same sentence as the word <i>might</i> for 328 of the 810 <i>might</i>
                        entries; this yields a percentage rate of 40.49%. I followed the same
                        criteria in my examination of the <i>perhaps</i> entries, and found that 103
                        of the 282 relevant examples contained an instance of another hedging
                        expression within the same sentence as the word <i>perhaps</i>—a percentage
                        of 36.52. In other words, around 40% of the hedged <i>might</i> and
                            <i>perhaps</i> expressions were in fact instances of double hedging—a
                        much, much larger figure than that given by Clyne (1991). This is a
                        substantial figure, examining over 1000 corpus entries. Even if I had been
                        using a very broad definition of hedging, which I have been clear to point
                        out I did not in fact use, 40% is a significantly large enough amount to
                        warrant the claim that, not only is double hedging acceptable, it is quite
                        common. The results of the <i>might</i> and <i>perhaps</i> search give us
                        the beginning of an awareness of the rate of occurrence of double-hedges
                        among already hedged expressions, but what of stronger types of hedges? How
                        common or rare are triple hedges, for example? In an attempt to answer these
                        question, I chose to look directly at an expression of double hedging—the <q type="quote">may + hedging lexical verb</q> feature mentioned as one
                        double-hedge collocation by Banks (1994a and 1994b) to see both how often
                        this collocation appears in the total number of <i>may</i> entries, and to
                        see if it tells us anything about triple hedging. The results of my findings
                        are as follows. A Wordsmith search produces a total number of 2256 entries
                        for the word <q>may</q>; after narrowing down these entries so that I was
                        left only with the entries where <i>may</i> was followed by a weak lexical
                        verb, I was left with 87 entries. This puts the percentage of <i>may</i>
                        entries taking the <q type="quote">may + weak lexical verb</q> form at
                        approximately 4%. It is important to emphasize here that this percentage is
                        in no way meant to suggest the overall percentage of double or multiple
                        hedging in the <i>may</i> entries; many of the entries deleted in this
                        specific analysis contained other hedging devices than weak lexical verbs
                        and thus, though they provided examples of multiply-hedged constructions,
                        were not included in the present results. The overall percentage of
                        <i>may</i> expressions which are doubly or multiply-hedged is therefore much
                        higher than 4%--likely somewhere closer to 40%, as suggested by the
                        <i>might</i> and <i>perhaps</i> entries results. It is also important to
                        point out here that I considered only a rather narrow set of verbs to be <q type="soCalled">weak</q> and therefore hedges. That is, my decisions
                        regarding whether or not to consider a lexical verb as <q type="soCalled">weak,</q> were quite a bit more selective than other researcher’s have
                        been, and only included verbs with a very weak level of assertion. For
                        example, I did not include indicate—the hedging status of which has been
                        debated (Johns 2001) or other more <q type="soCalled">questionable</q>
                        verbs. Had I included every non-factive verb encountered in the data (as
                        Crompton1997) does in his taxonomy of hedging), I would have had a much
                        higher figure of between 300 and 400 entries (13.3 % of all <i>may</i>
                        entries for 300 entries) fitting the <q type="quote">may + hedging lexical
                            verb</q> structure. As it is, though, I selected only 87 <q type="quote">may +lexical verb</q> entries, and of these 87, 26 entries—29.9%—had an
                        additional hedging device in the same sentence. Again, this is quite a
                        significant number. The data set is perhaps a bit too small to allow for any
                        definite conclusions, but this preliminary analysis places the rate of
                        triple hedging at around 30% of all double-hedged expressions. It would be
                        interesting to examine as well the occurrence of even larger congregations
                        of hedging expressions (i.e. quadruple hedging) to see where this relatively
                        strong occurrence rate drops off). These results show that, despite the
                        narrow criteria I assumed in looking at the data, the presence of multiple
                        hedges in academic text is quite strong; double hedging may occur as
                        commonly as in 40% of hedged expressions, and triple hedging seems to occur
                        at around a rate of 30% of double hedged expressions. </p><p> Next, let us turn to the survey. For this, an authentic academic article
                        (Martìn-Martìn &amp; Burgess 2004) that makes use of hedges was chosen
                        and each of the hedges in the first 7 paragraphs of the
                        Discussion/Conclusion section was highlighted and dropped into a
                        multiple-choice format where hedges of greater and lower strength framed the
                        original. Survey respondents were then asked to choose which of the
                        multiple-choice expressions seemed most appropriate to the sentence, without
                        knowing what expression actually occurred in the original. There were a
                        total of 29 multiple-choice sets, a double-hedged choice was given in 17 of
                        these 29 sets. There were 4 double-hedge expressions in this section of the
                        original article and all 4 were presented as options in the relevant
                        multiple-choice set. There were three groups of respondents (all of which
                        work or study at the University of Michigan): four undergraduate students in
                        the school of LS&amp;A, all of which are native speakers of English;
                        nine non-native English speaker graduate students from various fields; and
                        eight teachers of academic writing at UofM’s English Language Institute (a
                        center for ESL teaching, testing, and research). In considering the
                        completed surveys, I attempted to assess several elements: one is how likely
                        the respondents were to choose double-hedged expressions as an appropriate
                        choice (and to compare these choices to the double-hedged expressions in the
                        original; another is the level of conformity among the respondents’ answers
                        (in other words, were the respondents’ answers likely to match up? Or were
                        the respondents at least likely to consistently choose a weak rather than a
                        strong expression or a strong expression rather than a weak expression for a
                        given multiple-choice set); another is whether or not any of the groups had
                        a strong tendency to consistently choose stronger or weaker expressions than
                        the original expression (this could indicate a tendency to underhedge or
                        overhedge); and, of course, I did my best to note any other interesting
                        trends in the data. The results from each group are given, followed by a
                        comparison of the different groups’ results. </p><p> We start with an examination of the NS undergraduate group. The four
                        undergrads picked a total of 5 double-hedged expressions (several of which
                        were picked by more than one person for a total of 11) as an appropriate
                        choice; three of the respondents chose 2 double-hedges and the other
                        respondent chose 5, giving a group average of 2.75 double-hedges chosen as
                        acceptable by each person. Of the 11 chosen as acceptable, only 2 were not
                        double hedges in the original. In other words, the undergraduates usually
                        chose double-hedged expressions where a double-hedge appeared in the
                        original. However, only 3 of the 4 originally double-hedged expressions
                        resulted in a double-hedged choice by the undergrads. Specifically, the
                        double hedge <q type="example">may imply</q> which appeared in the original
                        was never chosen, and a stronger expression always selected instead. It is
                        interesting to note as well that the undergrads had a strong tendency to
                        correspondingly select expressions that were either weaker/same or
                        stronger/same than the original. In other words, for only 3 of the 29
                        multiple choice selections was there disagreement over whether the
                        appropriate expression should be stronger or weaker than the original. In
                        addition to the 3 expressions over which there was conflict, 12 of the
                        expressions were chosen as weaker or the same, 12 were chosen as stronger or
                        the same, and for 2 of the expressions, only the exact same expression was
                        chosen as appropriate by the undergrads. Although the undergraduate sample
                        may be a bit too small to offer definite conclusions, one can note some
                        interesting features of this data. One is that, overall, the undergrads seem
                        to have a sense of how much hedging is appropriate in a given clause, with
                        many of their answers matching the original expression and most others
                        differing from the original only by one or two degrees of strength. Another
                        is that, given their equal tendency to choose a stronger or weaker
                        expression, they seem unlikely to suffer from a tendency to underhedge or
                        overhedge. Indeed, if anything, the undergraduates may have a tendency not
                        necessarily to underhedge, but perhaps to avoid the use of double-hedges, as
                        their average number of double-hedged expressions chosen was a bit lower
                        than the number of double-hedged expressions in the original. However, the
                        general results of the study show that the undergraduates have a fairly good
                        grasp on hedging techniques (at least in recognition, one can’t conclude in
                        regards to production from the results of this survey) and the fact that
                        they have chosen a few double-hedge expressions here and there shows that,
                        though they may not always believe it the best option, they consider
                        double-hedging the appropriate choice in some cases. </p><p> Next, let’s turn to the NNS graduate students. It is worth mentioning that
                        all of the graduate students in this group are presently taking an ELI class
                        to help with their dissertation writing, indicating that they have either a
                        need for or an interest in ameliorating their EAP skills. The nine graduate
                        students picked 4 double-hedged expressions as the most appropriate choice
                        (several which were chosen more than once for a total of 15), with an
                        average of 1.666 double-hedges selected as appropriate by each person. Only
                        2 double-hedged expressions which were not double hedges in the original
                        were chosen as the most appropriate. Just as with the undergraduate group,
                        the majority of the double-hedge selections were double-hedges in the
                        original article as well. However, 2 of the 4 expressions which were
                        double-hedges in the original were never chosen by the grad students;
                        instead, a stronger selection was always chosen in its place: <q type="example">may imply,</q> which was also never chosen by the
                        undergrad group, and <q type="example">would seem.</q> Perhaps the modal
                        complexity of the expression <q type="example">would seem</q> was a bit
                        difficult to interpret for the NNSs, leading them to instead choose a more
                        straightforward option like <q type="example">seems.</q> The grad students
                        also evidenced a tendency to agree on whether an expression, if it differed
                        at all from its original, should be weaker or stronger than the original. In
                        6 of the 29 expressions there was some disagreement—at least one person
                        chose a stronger option while at least one other chose a weaker option, but
                        the other 23 expressions showed agreement. For 13 of these, the grad
                        students chose the same expression or a stronger one, for 9 of these the
                        grad students chose a weaker expression, and for 1 of these, every grad
                        student chose the same expression as that in the original. </p><p> Let us turn finally to the ELI writing teachers, eight of whom responded to
                        the survey. 12 different double-hedges were picked as appropriate by the
                        teachers (as with the other groups, several of these expressions were picked
                        by more than one person for a total of 32 double-hedge expressions
                        selected). In the case of the teachers, all 4 of the originally
                        double-hedged expressions were selected as appropriate by at least one
                        person—though the groups of teachers conformed with the other groups in that
                            <q type="example">may imply</q> was chosen very infrequently—only twice.
                        The other 3 originally double-hedged expressions appeared quite often among
                        the double-hedge selections, and in addition to these 4 originally
                        double-hedged expressions, 6 other double-hedges were chosen by at least one
                        person (and, interestingly, in many cases by more than one person). The
                        average number of double-hedge expressions per person for the teachers is
                        4.125—much higher than both other groups and very close to the original
                        number of double-hedges. It is interesting to note here, however, that while
                        the average fell at around 4 double-hedged expressions, only a couple of
                        teachers’ choices fell in range of this number. In other words, while some
                        teachers picked 6, 7, or as many as 8 double-hedged expressions as
                        appropriate choices, others chose only 2 double-hedges as good options, and
                        in two cases, only 1 double-hedge was selected. This indicates that personal
                        style perhaps plays a role in hedging, though to what extent, and whether
                        this is a feature only of EAP teachers and not EAP students is not clear.
                        Moving on, the teachers also, unsurprisingly, showed a strong likelihood to
                        agree, in the case of difference from the original, on whether an expression
                        should be stronger than the original expression or weaker than it. For 5 of
                        the multiple choice sets there was some disagreement, but the remainder
                        showed consensus: in 9 sets, the appropriate expression was chosen as
                        stronger than or the same as the original, in 13 cases, a weaker (or the
                        same) expression was chosen, and in 2 cases, only the original expression
                        was chosen as the appropriate option. This falls in interesting contrast to
                        the ELI students, whose results were the exact opposite: 9 were chosen as
                        weaker or the same and 13 as stronger or the same. </p><p> In sum, the average number of double-hedged expressions selected as
                        appropriate choices was highest for the teachers, a bit lower for the
                        undergraduate native speakers, and lowest for the ELI students. No group had
                        a significant tendency to choose stronger expressions rather than weaker
                        expressions or the original (which could indicate a tendency to underhedge)
                        or vice versa (which could indicate a tendency to overhedge)—though the
                        small differences pointed out above may have some significance; for example,
                        if we can consider the tendency to choose expressions of a certain level of
                        strength as evidence of use, it is possible that ELI students use stronger
                        language/less hedging in their writing than ELI teachers. It is not clear if
                        this stronger use of language would be a problem, but it would not hurt to
                        make the ELI students aware of this tendency and to clarify that multiple
                        hedges are a useful and acceptable strategy. We have seen also that each
                        group has a tendency to follow the same patterns (all going strong/same or
                        weak/same the majority of the time); the ELI students have the strongest
                        level of disagreement, but they are closely followed by the ELI teachers, so
                        it’s probably not a result of their lack of knowledge of the language (the
                        disagreement among ELI teachers may also be a result of stylistic
                        preferences, as discussed earlier in connection with the average number of
                        double-hedges chosen by the ELI teachers). Assuming that teachers have
                        authority on the subject, (which, it must be emphasized, is indeed an
                        assumption) the fact that the ELI teachers chose double hedges more than any
                        other group may indicate that both groups of students are not using double
                        hedges as much as they should, or at least could. Also, the ELI teachers’
                        double-hedge selection average is the closest of the three groups’ averages
                        to the actual number of double hedges in the original article—a bit of
                        evidence for their perhaps greater understanding of the phenomenon, though
                        one can not draw conclusions on rights to authority from this little bit of
                        evidence. Although not many options were given, triple hedges were never
                        chosen by any of the groups, indicating that they’re not terribly common
                        (recall that the Hyland data showed they were certainly acceptable—that is,
                        they occurred, but that they occur significantly less frequently than double
                        hedges. While the undergrads and ELI students would likely benefit from a
                        clearer understanding of hedging practices, it is not my intention here to
                        give the impression that the situation is grave and serious for these
                        students. First of all, although the student respondents examined here
                        tended to select multiple-hedges as appropriate options at a lower rate than
                        the teachers and at a lower rate than that which occurred in the actual
                        article, the rate of difference was not so large as to be alarming, and,
                        although I’d like to think that the results of the survey give some
                        indication of actual use in the respondents’ own writing, this does not
                        necessarily mean the students will be perceived as underhedgers. Secondly,
                        although the rhetorical culture of the US has tendency to put a lot of the
                        onus, in the case the communicative burden, onto the writer, we should
                        remember that many readers make allowances and would likely not be overly
                        disturbed by a bit too much indirectness or a bit too much directness; as
                        long as students aren’t making unwarranted dangerous claims in their writing
                        or hedging so much they make no claim at all, no great damage has been done.</p><p> In this section we have examined the frequency of double-hedging among
                        hedged expressions and the presence of triple hedging among double-hedged
                        expressions through a corpus search, and we have looked at attitudes towards
                        multiple hedging by both students (native and non-native English speakers)
                        and teachers of EAP and have made some inferences about levels of
                        multiple-hedge use among these groups. </p></div><div type="head_1"><head> V. Conclusion</head><p> We have established quite strongly that, no matter what beliefs were held in
                        the past, and no matter what disapproving attitudes remain today, hedging is
                        a common, legitimate, and useful rhetorical strategy. We have also
                        established that multiple hedging, though it can be overdone, occurs quite
                        frequently and is a useful technique for expressing strong degrees of
                        uncertainty. Hyland’s corpus of academic research articles has shown us that
                        hedged expressions occur in the presence of another hedge up to 40% of the
                        time, and that these double hedges are in fact triple hedges somewhere
                        around 30% of the time. We have also seen that, although students may use
                        multiple hedging less, double-hedges are considered acceptable options by
                        students and teachers of academic writing. Further research could attempt to
                        assess students writing, looking to see if multiple hedging does indeed
                        occur less than in the writing of so-called experts; research into the
                        influence of stylisitic preference on the use of hedging could also be
                        beneficial. Pedagogical theories and their practical counterparts,
                        textbooks, should take research such as the present into account, and more
                        textbooks would do good to follow in line with <i type="title">Academic
                            Writing for Graduate Students</i> by mentioning multiple hedging as a
                        useful and appropriate option. In the end, it seems that, despite what some
                        researchers may think and despite any lingering pejorative connotations
                        associated with hedging, hedged expressions, including multiply-hedged ones,
                        are, as Banks (1994) says <q type="quote">a requirement of scientific
                            journals</q> and an important technique for any scholar of EAP to have
                        up her sleeve. As it may be difficult for less experienced writers to
                        consistently select an appropriate level of hedging (due to the nuances of
                        lexical selection), teachers and EAP teaching materials must strive to make
                        it as clear to students as possible where this comfortable middle ground is
                        found. It is my hope that studies like the current one will help to turn
                        this goal into actuality. </p></div></div><div type="closer"><div type="bibliography"><head>References</head><listBibl><bibl>Banks, D. (1998). Vague quantification in the scientific journal
