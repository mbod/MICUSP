          Study</head><p/><div type="abstract"><head>Abstract</head><p>Using generalized method of moments on the covariance matrix, I test three models of
            consumption change on constructed consumption data from the Health and Retirement Study.
            Meant as a first step towards estimating life-cycle effects of subjective survival
            probabilities on consumption profiles, this study finds that the model that best
            describes the consumption data is a pure measurement error model. This is likely due to
            the large amount of error introduced in the process of inferring consumption from other
            financial data. This result casts significant doubt on the use of this data in
            estimating a life-cycle model.</p><p>(Note: this paper duplicates some expository material from Perry (2005))</p></div></div><div type="main"><div type="head_1"><head>I. Introduction</head><p>The primary concern of this paper is whether household consumption values constructed
          from wealth and income data in the Health and Retirement Study are accurate enough to be
          of use in estimating an Euler equation describing consumption in a model with uncertain
          lifetimes. This paper is a companion to Perry (2005) in which I actually attempt to
          estimate that equation.</p><p>People's beliefs about their own life-expectancy have not been extensively studied-mainly
          due to lack of data. It is not clear that people actually have consistent beliefs about
          their own chances of survival at any time. Even if they do, measuring them in a meaningful
          and convincing way is difficult. </p><p>The life-cycle hypothesis makes a simple prediction about the relationship between a
          person's perceived risk of death and their consumption: those who think they are less
          likely to die will have less consumption growth over time. Simply put, if you expect to
          live a long time, you will conserve your resources early in life in order to have enough
          later-this means earlier consumption will be lower than it would have been if you had
          thought your chances of survival were worse, ceteris paribus. In this way, a higher
          expected chance of survival should have the same effect as a higher interest rate or a
          lower degree of impatience. </p><p>The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) has elicited subjective life-expectation data from
          its respondents since the study's inception in 1992 (12 waves of the HRS have been
          completed-1992-2002, every two years). The questions are of the form <q type="quote">What
            is the percent chance that you will live to be 75 or more?</q> (the target age-75 in
          this case-can vary). </p><p>The HRS, however, does not elicit consumption data from respondents. Instead, it provides
          measurements of assets, income and capital gains. These can be used to deduce a
          consumption level for the time periods between survey interviews. This process leads to a
          large amount of measurement error, though, as the assets, income and capital gains are all
          measured with non-trivial measurement error to begin with.</p><p>While my primary goal is to study the relationship between consumption profiles and
          subjective survival beliefs, this study is a first step in which I test constructed HRS
          consumption data against three alternative models of consumption-specifically, models of
          the covariance structure of changes in log-consumption. I find that a model describing
          consumption as an individual-specific constant plus a time-varying random shock best
          describes the data. This can either be interpreted as showing that the consumption values
          have too much error to be of significant use for this application or as showing that that
          process describes real respondent consumption in this dataset. In either case, the result
          indicates that this dataset is probably not of much use in testing the primary
          relationship of interest.</p><p>In section one I describe the three models of consumption that I test the data against.
          In section two I describe the data and how I produced my values of consumption. Section
          three contains the results of fitting the data to the three models.</p></div><div type="head_1"><head>II. Consumption Models</head><p>My method is to propose a model for the consumption data; use it to derive conditions on
          the covariance between the changes in log-consumption in different periods; and then use
          those conditions to fit the data to that model using generalized method of moments as
          described in the appendix of Abowd and Card (1989). </p><div type="head_2"><head>Measurement Error Model</head><p>The first model I propose to test is a model in which an individual's log-consumption
          equals a person-specific constant plus a random shock that changes each period:</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>(1)</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>.</p><p>This implies that the change in log consumption between two periods is given by:</p><gap desc="formula"/><p> ,(2)</p><p>and </p><gap desc="formula"/><p>(3).</p><p>As stated in the introduction, this model can thought of as a model of pure measurement
          error, or alternatively as actually describing the process that describes real
          consumption. The only parameter value to be estimated is <gap desc="formula"/>.</p></div><div type="head_2"><head>Random Walk Model</head><p>The second model I test is a variation on the random-walk model of consumption proposed
          by Hall (1978). The variation is that I propose (for convenience) to test whether
          log-consumption follows a random walk. The proposed model is </p><gap desc="formula"/><p> (4)</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>.</p><p>I ignore the issue of whether there is an additional trend term as that will not be
          identified by the GMM approach I take. Equation (4) implies</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>(5).</p><p>Therefore, the covariance structure of changes in log consumption is:</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>(6).</p><p>Similar to the measurement error model, the only parameter to be estimated is <gap desc="formula"/>. However, this model implies zero covariance for elements that will
          have non-zero covariance in the measurement error model.</p></div><div type="head_2"><head>Life-Cycle Model with Uncertain Lifetime</head><p>The third model I test is based on the life-cycle implication stated in the introduction.
          The implication that consumption growth should rise with a rise in a person's mortality
          risk comes directly from the Euler equation of an agent maximizing the sum of additively
          separable utility over his lifetime (my formulation is borrowed from Kuehlwein, 1993):</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>(7).</p><p>Here, p is the probability of surviving to the next period, r is the interest rate and
            <gap desc="formula"/> is the rate of time-preference. Lowering p has the same effect as
          raising <gap desc="formula"/> or lowering r-it privileges current consumption over future
          consumption. In this way, because I have no measurement of <gap desc="formula"/>, the
          effect of survival expectations will not be separately identified from the effect of
          time-preference. I ignore the issue of the utility value of a bequest upon dying.</p><p>I assume a felicity function <gap desc="formula"/> (constant relative risk aversion with
          relative risk aversion parameter <gap desc="formula"/>), and take the logarithm of each
          side. Also, because my main concern is with life-span uncertainty, I assume that the
          income stream is known. This means that there should be no uncertainty about realized
          consumption in period t+1, given that the respondent survives to that period, so I
          dispense with the expectation operator:</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>(8).</p><p>Adding a term to account for measurement error in the change in log-consumption gives:</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>(9).</p><p>I assume that <gap desc="formula"/> and <gap desc="formula"/> for all t.</p><p>As written, equation (9) should apply only to a single agent making decisions for
          himself. Analyzing a similar case for a multi-person household in which agents care for
          each other's well-being requires further assumptions about how those agents interact and
          make decisions together. </p><p>The only variables from (9) that I have measured variation in are consumption and
          subjective survival expectation. Therefore, I make the possibly unfounded assumptions that
          the difference between log rt and log <gap desc="formula"/> is distributed randomly in the
          population given log(pt), and that <gap desc="formula"/> is constant (or distributed
          randomly) throughout the population. This leaves the relationship that I examine:</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>,(10)</p><p>substituting <gap desc="formula"/> and <gap desc="formula"/>. This equation implies the
          covariance structure:</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>(11).</p><p>The GMM estimation of this model will fit values of both <gap desc="formula"/> and <gap desc="formula"/>. Note that if <gap desc="formula"/>, then this reduces to the
          random-walk model.</p></div></div><div type="head_1"><head>III. Data</head><p>The HRS is a nationally representative panel study of persons over 50 in the United
          States. Beginning in 1992, respondents were interviewed every two years, covering health,
          finances, physical and mental capabilities, family structure and relationships and job
          history. A study called AHEAD (Assets and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old) began in 1993
          and focused on older respondents. In 1996, the AHEAD study merged with HRS. New cohorts
          were added to HRS in 1998 so that the survey would remain representative of those over 50.
          The last wave of data available for this analysis comes from interviews done in 2002. I
          employ all HRS waves, but I do not use AHEAD data that was taken prior to the merger with
          HRS.</p><p>Table 1 shows descriptive statistics of the population that I will use for this analysis.
          In each survey wave this population consists of all respondents who answered at least one
          subjective survival question in that wave and who were single throughout the time
          1992-2002. P(75) and P(85) refer to the mean values of the probability responses to the
          subjective survival questions that ask about target ages of 75 and 85 respectively<ptr type="footnote" target="fn1"/>. These statistics are meant simply to make it clear what
          the population of respondents is like in any particular year. They cannot be used to make
          accurate inferences about the evolution of households or singles in the HRS population
          over time because those respondents who have a valid answer to at least one subjective
          survival question are a highly non-random group. This is due to both self-selection (it
          takes a certain mental capacity to give a sensible answer to a probability question) and
          due to survey variation (exactly which sets of respondents have been asked which questions
          has varied over time in the HRS).</p><div type="head_2"><head>Measuring Consumption</head><p>Each wave of the HRS contains detailed questions on household assets (both real and
          financial), household income (separate from capital gains), and capital gains. The survey
          does not contain any consistent measure of household consumption. In order to test the
          implication of survival expectations on consumption profiles, I use the HRS data on
          assets, income and capital gains to infer a measure of consumption for each respondent for
          each period between survey interviews.</p><p>The basis of the calculation is the relationship:</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>.(12)</p><p>That is, consumption between two measured points in time equals whatever the household
          took in, in earned income and capital gains, minus the amount that their asset level grew
          during that period. It is ambiguous in the HRS whether respondents give pre-tax or
          post-tax income levels and so there is no way to account for income tax. I do, however
          subtract property taxes from inferred consumption.</p><p>First, I use the HRS income data to estimate household income over the period between
          survey interviews. I divide the study's constructed household income variable-which
          estimates total household income in the one-year period prior to the interview-by twelve
          to get an estimated monthly income and then multiply by the number of months between
          interviews. This procedure will add measurement error to the extent that actual household
          income during the period between interviews differs from income during the period just
          prior to the interview. Additionally, all financial variables in the HRS include imputed
          values which increase the level of measurement error, but also substantially increase the
          number of data points available. To exclude the imputed values from this analysis would
          entail dropping a majority of the available data since almost all respondents require
          imputation on at least some financial variables.</p><p>Second, I use the capital gains section of the survey to estimate capital gains between
          survey interviews. Respondents are asked whether they have put money in to or taken money
          out from their various assets. This information, combined with the asset values reported
          in the earlier and later waves, allows for inference of the respondent's capital gains
          over the period. This is straightforward except that housing capital gains are not
          well-measured for respondents who buy or sell a house during the period, so those
          respondents are dropped. </p><p>Finally, I calculate respondents' change in assets between the survey interviews by
          subtracting the later survey-interview household assets variable from the earlier
          survey-interview household assets variable. I do not include housing assets on the
          assumption that people-particularly retired people-do not generally monetize housing
          assets for the sake of consumption. Descriptively, this assumption is probably alright for
          the period 1992-2002, but may be less so now.</p><p>Adding income and capital gains and subtracting asset growth and property taxes and then
          deflating by the CPI-U yields the measure of consumption in 2002 dollars that is used to
          test the life-cycle prediction. </p><p>Using this strategy I have measures of consumption for the periods between the survey
          waves 1992 and 1994, 1994 and 1996, 1996 and 1998, 1998 and 2000 and 2000 and 2002. These
          five sets of consumption data can be used to calculate four cross-sections of
          log-consumption growth, the statistic of interest in the Euler equation. Table 2 shows
          summary statistics for the measures of consumption in 2002 dollars and log-consumption
          growth. Panel A shows consumption measured for all households consumption measured for
          households composed of singles. Panel B shows log-consumption growth measured for all
          households and for singles. The values in Panel A can be thought of as approximately
          2-year levels of consumption for those households as that is approximately the time
          between survey interviews. Panel C, most relevant for this study, shows consumption and
          log-consumption growth for those singles who exist throughout the entire panel period and
          who have no negative consumption values-these are the respondents the model is estimated
          for. This group is different from the overall singles group in two major ways. First,
          consumption levels are much more steady through the period-perhaps because it is always
          the same group of people. Consumption for each approximately two-year period is always
          approximately $50-60K. Second, for both of the other groups (all households and all
          singles) consumption growth is negative for the first three periods and positive in the
          last. For this group of singles, consumption growth is negative in the first period and
          positive thereafter. I have no explanation for that difference.</p><p>Two elements of this table suggest large measurement error. First, in each year a large
          proportion of households have negative values for this measure of consumption-typically
          11-15%. Because actual consumption cannot be negative, these cases are necessarily
          mis-measured. The proportion of negative cases is a lower bound on the proportion of
          mis-measured cases in each year. The large number of negative values also explains why the
          number of cases is significantly lower in Panel B and Panel C than Panel A-if there is a
          negative value in either the early period or the late period, then log-consumption growth
          cannot be measured.</p><p>Second is the fact that, for both the whole population and for singles, measured
          consumption drops substantially for the period 1998-2000 and then rises substantially for
          the period 2000-2002. This may be due to unreported capital gains appearing in the change
          in asset level. If a respondent had substantial capital gains in 1998-2000 (as many did),
          then did not report them as capital gains and did correctly report their total assets,
          this would result in measured consumption being biased downwards. The reverse is likely
          for the period 2000-2002. Poorly measured capital gains are probably not restricted to
          these time periods-they just show up strongly in these periods because asset values
          fluctuated substantially. </p><p>The HRS does provide a few variables that can be used to corroborate my deduced
          consumption values. In 1996 and 1998 the survey asked each household what their total
          spending-including all debt payments, utility bills, rent, transportation, entertainment,
          food, clothes and any other expenses-was in the previous month. Also, in 2002, the survey
          asked three food consumption questions: how much did the household spend in the past week
          on all food; how much did it spend having food delivered; and how much did it spend eating
          out. The left side of table 3 shows mean values for these measures and for deduced
          consumption values measured on a monthly basis for the same time period. The HRS survey
          levels of consumption are substantially lower in both cases. Also included are mean values
          of inferred consumption with negative values removed-this exacerbates the difference
          between the HRS measure and my measure. It is questionable how accurate a respondent is
          likely to be in making a fast estimate of monthly spending, so there is no guarantee that
          the HRS measure is very good. One possible, partial explanation for the large difference
          between the values reported by respondents and the calculated values is that I have not
          accounted for income tax. If respondents generally report pre-tax income, then my
          calculation will count their taxes as consumption. It seems likely that few respondents
          would include income tax in their response to the 1996 and 1998 HRS consumption question. </p><p>The right side of table 3 shows correlation coefficients and respective significance
          levels between the HRS measures and my inferred levels of consumption for the relevant
          time periods. For both HRS consumption measures, the correlation is substantially higher
          when the negative cases are removed from the deduced consumption numbers. This is
          unsurprising as those cases almost certainly represent particularly egregious cases of
          measurement error. Furthermore, it is encouraging that the inferred consumption shows such
          a high correlation with the HRS measures of consumption given the likely presence of
          substantial measurement error in both. Interestingly, of the food consumption measures in
          2002, only the measurement of what a family spends eating at restaurants is significantly
          correlated with my inferred consumption measure. Also interesting, though I have not shown
          it, is that these measures of food consumption correlate very little with each other-again
          probably due to measurement error.</p><p>Table 3 shows that despite its weaknesses, my inference about household consumption do
          match up to a substantial degree with the limited information the HRS survey provides
          about actual household consumption.</p></div><div type="head_2"><head>Measuring Subjective Survival Expectations</head><p>In the Euler equation that provides the hypothesis tested, p represents the agent's
          subjective assessment of his probability of living to the next period. The HRS provides
          answers to questions of the form <q type="quote">What is the percent chance that you will
            live to be 75 or more?</q> These questions are asked twice in each survey wave with
          different target ages, although some respondents may only be asked once or not at all.
          From 1992 to 1998 respondents were asked the questions with 75 as a target age and then
          with 85 as a target age. In 2000 and 2002, the first question remains the same and the
          second question has a target age that varies from 80 to 100 in five year increments
          depending on the age of the respondent (the target for anyone under 70 was 80, for those
          70-74 it was 85 and so on). </p><p>A response to one of these questions does not imply directly any particular value of the
          respondent's expected chance of living to any particular date other than the target age.
          In order to use the survey responses to calculate a value of p (in the life-cycle model
          the probability of living to the next period; in this analysis the probability of living
          through the next period of measured consumption) for each respondent, some assumptions are
          necessary. In the appendix, I describe an algorithm I use to produce values of p from the
          responses to the subjective survival questions in the survey.</p></div><div type="head_2"><head>Covariances of Log-Consumption Growth</head><p>The object I use to fit the three proposed models to the data is the covariance matrix of
          log-consumption growth. This is shown, along with the corresponding correlation matrix in
          table 4. Significance levels are shown for the correlation coefficients as well (a value
          of 1%, e.g., indicates that the correlation is very significant). As can be shown
          relatively easily, the pure measurement error model implies a correlation matrix with -1/2
          on the elements one-removed from the diagonal in the correlation matrix and zero for the
          other off-diagonal elements. Prima facie, the correlation matrix of the data appears very
          close to that-with one-off diagonal elements close to -1/2 and highly significant and no
          other significant correlations.</p></div></div><div type="head_1"><head>IV. Results</head><p>The results of GMM estimation are presented in table 5. Results are shown both for
          optimal minimum-distance (OMD) estimation, using the inverse of the variance matrix of the
          vector of covariance elements as a weighting matrix, and for equal-weighted minimum
          distance (EWMD) estimation, using the identity matrix as a weighting matrix. In both
          cases, we cannot reject the measurement error model at standard significance levels and we
          can reject the other two models. Indeed, the random-walk model and the life-cycle model
          both fit the data very poorly-producing very high chi-square statistics. (Note in table 5,
          I use the term p-value to indicate the probability of observing a <gap desc="formula"/>
          value at least that high given the proposed model.)</p><p>There are two other results to note in table 5. First, the value of <gap desc="formula"/>
          that minimized the test statistic for the life-cycle model is zero. This reduces the
          life-cycle model to the random walk model-indeed the values for <gap desc="formula"/> are
          the same for each model. The models produce different <gap desc="formula"/> values in the
          EWMD case because although they minimize the same statistic, the test statistic for that
          minimization depends on the first derivative of the vector of covariance elements with
          respect to the parameter vector. In the life-cycle model this derivative depends on the
          covariances of p (the subjective survival probabilities). In the random walk model, this
          derivative is a vector of constants.</p><p>Second, OMD and EWMD produce very similar parameter values for the well-fitting model,
          but very different values for the poorly-fitting model. Abowd and Card note this issue and
          that is their justification for using both-it serves as another test of how well the model
          fits. </p><p>The primary implication of these results is that this data is unlikely to be of much use
          in estimating the life-cycle model that is really the object of interest. Because of the
          procedure used to produce the consumption data, I conjecture that the results of this
          study indicate a large amount of measurement error in the data, rather than a real
          consumption process for survey respondents. </p><p>As the main goal of this research program is to investigate whatever link may exist
          between people's stated survival beliefs and their decision-making, it will be necessary
          either to derive a testable result that does not rely on consumption data or to find a
          dataset that measures both survival expectations and consumption.</p></div></div><div type="closer"><div type="bibliography"><head>References</head><listBibl><bibl>Abowd, J.M., and Card, D. (1989): "On the Covariance Structure of Earnings and

            chance that you will live to be 75 or more?" implies a belief over all the conditional
            probabilities of surviving one year into the future (that is, for example, the
            probability of surviving to age 63 given that the respondent has survived to age 62) for
            each year from the respondent's current age up to the age of 75. Assuming that these
            probabilities exist, the response to the question is just the product of all conditional
            probabilities from the respondent's age to the target age:</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>.(13)</p><p>Here, R is the survey response, A is the age of the respondent, T is the target age and
              <gap desc="formula"/> is the probability of surviving to age i, given that the
            respondent has survived to age i-1. In order to calculate values of <gap desc="formula"/>, it is necessary to assume something about how respondents' beliefs change over time.
            I assume that respondents recognize that their conditional survival probabilities fall
            somewhat each year that they age<ptr type="footnote" target="fn2"/>. Over the relatively
            short time of a decade, actual life-table survival probabilities decline approximately
            linearly. For this reason and for simplicity, I assume that declines by a constant
            amount each year. This simplifies the expression in (13) to </p><gap desc="formula"/><p>,(14)</p><p>where m is the amount by which survival probabilities decrease each year and H=T-A.
            Taking logs of both sides gives</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>.(15)</p><p>Then, set <gap desc="formula"/>. Actual mortality rates, even for people into their
            eighties are typically below 0.1-meaning that in actual outcome, survival probabilities
            are quite close to one for any given year. I assume that respondents' beliefs conform
            well-enough to actual outcomes that I can use the approximation <gap desc="formula"/> in
            equation . This yields</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>(16)</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>,(17)</p><p>where equation (17) follows by using standard summation results.</p><p>This is the equation I use to describe the relationship between a response and a
            respondent's beliefs in the first wave of the survey (1992). Because other responses
            occur at different times and for different target ages, there is variation in the values
            of H and therefore the multipliers of r and m. For example, if equation (17) represents
            the relationship between beliefs and response for the question with target age 75, asked
            in 1992, then the same relationship for target age 80, asked in 2000 of the same
            respondent looks like:</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>(18)</p><p>where <gap desc="formula"/>. The difference in H is due to the respondent's age having
            advanced eight years between surveys and the target age increasing by five years. The
            addition of 8 to the multiplier on m is due to all conditional survival probabilities
            having declined by 8m as the respondent aged during the time between 1992 and 2000.</p><p>Using these relationships, I have a vector of responses, R, and a matrix of multipliers
            for r and m, X, for each respondent. This allows me to estimate the regression</p><gap desc="formula"/><p>(19)</p><p>separately for each respondent, thereby giving values of r and m for each respondent
            who has answered at least three subjective survival questions. In this formulation, r is
            the respondent's perceived risk of death in the first year (set to 1992 for all
            respondents since that is the first year of survey data for any respondents), and,
            again, m is the yearly increase in risk of death. Using these numbers, I calculate a
            respondent's perceived risk of death in year x as riskx=r+(x-1992)m, or equivalently, I
            calculate their perceived probability of survival during year x as px=1-riskx.</p><p>The above explanation elides the issue that when a respondent answers zero, it is
            impossible to take a log and use that response in the calculation. I implement two
            strategies to deal with this issue and test which seems to work better. First, I exclude
            all responses of zero from the calculations. Above, we established that those who answer
            100 seem to be similar to those who answer zero, and additionally, they seem to be the
            same sort of unlikely answer to a probability question-perhaps due to misunderstanding.
            For that reason, when I exclude the zeros I also exclude the 100s. For the second
            strategy, instead of excluding the zeros and 100s, I replace the zeroes with the value
            0.00001, which can be logged, and I replace the 100s (really 1s since everything is
            converted to fractions) with 0.99999. </p><p>In each case, I use the values of <gap desc="formula"/> and m generated for each
            respondent to calculate the respondent's perceived probability of survival during any
            year. These predicted yearly subjective survival values can be multiplied together as in
            to produce predicted responses to any of the subjective survival questions on the
            survey. To test my two strategies, I regress the actual responses on the predicted
            responses. The results are shown in Appendix Table 1. Strategy 1 drops responses of zero
            or 100, strategy 2 replaces them. The first two sets of R2 values are for regressions
            over the same responses. The last set is for strategy 2 used to predict for all
            responses for which it is possible to do so. The number of possible cases using strategy
            2 is larger because dropping responses in strategy 1 necessarily means reducing some
            respondents to below the three-response level necessary for prediction. Strategy 1
            produces a better set of predicted responses in all cases. This could be because answers
            of zero or 100 are more likely to reflect confusion than information about held beliefs. </p><p>Perhaps needless to say, I do not hypothesize that any respondent has set beliefs about
            his or her conditional probability of surviving during any particular year. It would be
            claiming too much to say that the HRS questions evoke anything more than a general
            impression of survival probability from most respondents (the exception perhaps being
            any professional actuaries surveyed). The scheme I propose for integrating all of a
            respondent's answers is intended to be a fairly straightforward way of approximating
            what a respondent's well-articulated beliefs might look like if they were forced to
            develop them in a rigorous way and if they had some consistency over time. Therefore,
            the charge could easily be leveled that I have invented an index with a dubious
            epistemic nature. My only response is that I see no other simple strategy for
            incorporating all of a respondent's answers that is not at least as questionable. It may
            well be that questions like those on the HRS are simply not sophisticated enough to use
            in testing life-cycle models. </p><gap desc="table"/><p>Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Single HRS Respondents used in this study</p><gap desc="table"/><p>Table 2: Measured Consumption and Log-Consumption Growth</p><gap desc="table"/><p>Table 3: Comparison of HRS Consumption Measures with Inferred Consumption</p><gap desc="table"/><p>Table 4: Covariance and Correlation of Log-Consumption Growth</p><gap desc="table"/><p>Table 5: Estimation Results</p><gap desc="table"/><p>Appendix Table 1: R-squared values for Regressions of Actual on Predicted Responses</p></div><div type="footnotes"><note type="footnote" id="fn1">1 P(85) is a misnomer for the 2000 and 2002 waves because
