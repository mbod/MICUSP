type="head_1"><head>Introduction</head><p>Students of environmental conservation are well aware of the canon, <q type="quote">Think Globally, Act Locally,</q> but to what extent is the global aspect actually realized?  People should be more inclined to act locally more than globally, but what causes an individual to think globally?  In other words, how far (literally) do our own environmental values span?  Using and adding to research on the psychology of choice, and the effects of framing and protected values, this experiment tests the <i type="soCalled">scope</i> of people's environmental concerns.  Here, I test how international versus national environmental issues effect people's choices.</p><p>Tversky and Kahneman (1981: 453) argue that rational decision-makers will prefer prospects that offer the <q type="quote">highest expected utility.</q> However, this rationality may be thwarted when prospects are framed differentially, in terms of gains and losses.  When prospects are framed in terms of gains, the chosen option is more likely to be risk averse.  In contrast, when prospects are framed in terms of losses, the chosen option is more likely to be risk-taking.   Tversky and Kahneman (1981) argue that people do not simply become irrational, but rather they make <i type="soCalled">bounded</i> decisions based on the most readily available, although limited, information.  </p><p>Protected values may confound these framing effects.  Protected values are firmly held ethical beliefs about one's duties and rights as a human being.  Such values shape individual behavior because people are concerned not only with the consequences of the action, but also with the very nature of their own <i type="quote">participation</i> (Baron &amp; Spranca, 1997).  People with protected values cannot trade their personal values for others, and if they do, they are unhappy with their decision.  Baron and Spranca (1997) suggest that protected values prohibit certain actions.  Tanner and Medin (2004), in contrast, argue that protected values influence people to act, out of moral obligation; active moral obligation is stronger than moral prohibition of actions.  </p><p>Tanner and Medin qualify their argument by suggesting that, at least in terms of environmental values and behavior, <q type="quote">prohibitions against action may be salient when the act can be seen as causing harm. In contrast, obligation to act may be more salient when the act can be seen as promoting something good</q> (in press: 4).  Thus, there may be a relationship between the framing of the action prospects/options, such that harm (negativity) induces omission, while good actions (positivity) induces action.  This argument holds, however, only when protected values are present and strong.  Tanner and Medin suggest that when protected values are lacking, or even weakly present, tendencies are, as Tversky and Kahneman (1981) argue, malleable such that the way a prospect is framed may sway one's answer.</p></div><div type="head_1"><head>Experimental Question and Predictions</head><p>This experiment, then, will test an individual's reaction to different types of framed national and international environmental conservation situations.  Several predictions are made, based on the above research.</p><p>1) If protected values do not exist, participant choices will be influenced by the way in which the scenario prospects are framed:  </p><list><item>a)   When prospects are framed in terms of gains (positive), the chosen option is more likely to be risk averse.  (framing affect present)</item><item>b)  When prospects are framed in terms of losses (negative), the chosen option is more likely to be risk-taking.  (framing affect present)</item><item>c)   National scenarios will evoke a stronger framing effect than will international scenarios.</item><item>d) The intensity of the framing effect will highest for charismatic endangered species scenarios, lower for non-charismatic endangered species scenarios, and lowest for forest remnant scenarios.</item></list><p>2) If protected values do exist, participant choices will be less influenced by the way in which the scenario prospects are framed:</p><list><item>a)  The presence of national protected values will result in a lower or absent framing effect for national scenarios, but not for international scenarios.</item><item>b)  The presence of international protected values will result in a lower or absent framing effect for international values, but not for national scenarios.</item></list></div><div type="head_1"><head>Research Design and Methodology</head><p>	This experiment was conducted through the use of e-mail surveys.  The surveys were not anonymous, as respondents sent their responses to my e-mail address.  I  received 236 responses from people of various backgrounds and educational interests/career paths, and from across the United States.</p><div type="head_2"><head>Section One: Protected Values Questions</head><p>To establish the presence/absence and intensity of protected values, participants were given a set of three national environmental statements and three international environmental statements.  For each statement they chose one of three opinions: </p><list><item>(a) This is acceptable </item><item>(b) This is acceptable only under certain conditions</item><item>(c) This is not acceptable no matter how great the benefits are.</item></list><p>Selecting option c is evidence of an environmental protected value.  The statements were </p><p>as follows: </p><list><item>1. Running the water in the sink when brushing your teeth <i>(national)</i></item><item>2. Cutting old growth red wood forest by the owner <i>(national)</i></item><item>3. Buying timber from Amazon rain forest <i>(international)</i></item><item>4. Buying vegetables grown on cleared rain forest <i>(international)</i></item><item>5. Shooting a black bear that is in your campsite <i>(national)</i></item><item>6. Building a factory which will prevent outsourcing jobs, but will be somewhat damaging for the environment <i>(national)</i></item><item>7. Using a cell phone that has materials mined from gorilla habitat <i>(international)</i></item><item>8. Eating a hamburger made from beef raised on Amazon rain forest <i>(international)</i></item><item>9. Letting your car run idle for 20 minutes while waiting for a friend <i>(national)</i></item><item>10. Wearing a coat, shoes, belt or bag made from exotic, endangered hide or fur <i>(international)</i></item></list></div><div type="head_2"><head>Section Two: Environmental Scenarios</head><p>Immediately after selecting their opinions about the environmental statements, respondents proceeded to the environmental scenario section. Half of the participants (Group A) received scenarios with only negatively-framed prospects, and half of the participants (Group B) received scenarios with only positively-framed prospects. All participants received the same 3 international scenarios and 3 national scenarios.  Both types had one scenario based on each of the following environmental issues: non charismatic endangered species, charismatic endangered species, and forest resources.  To reduce bias, the actual survey did not denote the framing, scope, or categorical nature of the question (e.g. <q type="example">international, forest resources, positive frame</q> will not be mentioned). </p><p>For this experiment, the framing (positive/negative), scope (national/international) and category (environmental issue) of each scenario are the independent variables, and the choice made by the respondent- the effect of the framing, scope and category- is the independent variable.  This paper describes only the results of framing and scope, but addresses environmental issues in the discussion.</p><div type="head_3"><head>National situation #1: non-charismatic endangered species</head><p>You were born and raised in the Midwest.

Upon getting a new job, you move to Arizona, where the climate is a bit different from where you grew up.  People have rocks instead of lawns and cacti instead of roses!

The average percent of respondents which held at least one national protected value was 33%; the average for international protected values was 47%.  This suggests that the scope of protected values can expand well beyond national borders.  While not tested against actual behavior, it is likely that protected values are higher for international environmental issues simply because it is <i>easier</i> to <q type="soCalled">care</q> about issues which are remote from one's one life.</p><p>Table 2 shows the percentage of respondents, independent of protected values who selected option 1, 2, or 0 (zero signifies surveys where respondents refused to choose an option; this will be discussed in the justifications section).  For 5 of the 6 positively framed scenarios, and 4 of the 6 negatively framed scenarios, respondents chose the predicted options, 1 (risk averse)and 2(risk taking), respectively.</p><gap desc="table"/><p>In the analysis of the data, I categorized protected values into three groups:</p><list><item>1. Total number of protected values (0-4 = LOW, 5-9 = HIGH)</item><item>2. Total number of international protected values (0-2 = LOW, 3-5 = HIGH)</item><item>3. Total number of national protected values (0-2 = LOW, 3-5 = HIGH)</item></list><div type="head_2"><head>LOW OR NO PROTECTED VALUES</head><p>For respondents with no or low protected values, results were the same for all three categories (TABLE 3):</p><gap desc="table"/><p>As predicted, a framing effect was found for respondents with low or no protected values: for 4 out of 6 negatively framed scenarios, there were more respondents who chose option 2, the risk-taking choice. The framing effect was absent for scenario 3 (national) and scenario 5 (international).  The framing effect was <i>not</i> stronger in national scenarios than in international scenarios, as was predicted.</p><p>Also as predicted, for 5 out of 6 positively framed scenarios, there were more respondents who chose option 1, the risk-averse choice.  The framing effect was absent for scenario 3 (national).  The framing affect was much stronger in the positively framed group than the negatively framed group, however, the framing effect was not stronger in national scenarios than in international scenarios, as was predicted</p></div><div type="head_2"><head>HIGH TOTAL PROTECTED VALUES: POSITIVE FRAME</head><p>Table 4 shows that, as predicted, when protected values are high, there is no framing affect (although a slight effect is seen in scenario 2).  In fact, scenarios 3, 4, 5, and 6 show an effect in the opposite direction; more people chose option 1. </p><gap desc="table"/></div><div type="head_2"><head>NATIONAL PROTECTED VALUES, NEGATIVE FRAME</head><p>For respondents with high national protected values, a framing effect is seen only in scenario 2 (which, interestingly, is a national scenario).   (TABLE 5)  Scenarios 1, 3, and 5 show a tendency to select option 1 rather than option 2, and scenarios 4 and 5 resulted in an equal selection of option 1 and 2.</p><gap desc="table"/></div><div type="head_2"><head>INTERNATIONAL PROTECTED VALUES, NEGATIVE FRAME</head><p>For respondents with high international protected values, negatively framed scenarios did not produce a framing effect.  In fact, in scenarios 3, 4, 5, and 6, respondents selected option 1.  There was a weak framing effect towards option 2 in scenario 1 and 2.  This illustrates that the presence of high international protected values severely decreases the framing effect for international, but not national, scenarios.</p><gap desc="table"/></div><div type="head_2"><head>TOTAL PROTECTED VALUES, POSITIVE FRAME</head><p>For total protected values, all positively framed scenarios tended to show the same framing effect; That is, option 1 was chosen more than option 2 (TABLE 7).  Thus, protected values did not seem to lessen the framing effect for positively framed scenarios.</p><gap desc="table"/></div><div type="head_2"><head>INTERNATIONAL PROTECTED VALUES, POSITIVE FRAME</head><p>For international protected values, again there continued to be a framing effect for all scenarios; that is, option 1 was chosen more than option 2.  For scenarios 2 and 6 the framing effect was even stronger; that is, a larger percentage of respondents with international protected values selected option 1 than the percentage of respondents without international protected values (TABLE 8).  The table illustrates that the presence of high international protected values decreases the framing effect for both international and national scenarios.</p><gap desc="table"/></div><div type="head_2"><head>NATIONAL PROTECTED VALUES, POSITIVE FRAME</head><p>For national protected values, positive scenarios 1, 4, and 5 showed the same framing effect; that is, option 1 was chosen more than option 2.  For scenarios 2 and 3 an equal number of respondents chose option 1 and option 2.  For scenario 6, more respondents chose option 2 than chose option 1 (TABLE 9). </p><gap desc="table"/></div><div type="head_2"><head>REFUSAL TO SELECT AN OPTION</head><p>	Baron and Spranca (1997) suggest that people with protected values often will not even <i>consider</i> scenarios that conflict with their values.  People can exhibit anger, bewilderment, and indignation, and subsequently choose neither of the options and (Tanner and Medin,1997).  Table 10 shows that only a few (no more than 4% of respondents for any one scenario, positively or negatively framed; also shown in Table 2) refused to select an option.  Protected values, however, were not always high for these individuals.  This was particularly true for the respondents with positively framed surveys, where the majority of had low protected values (granted, this ranges from 2-4 individuals).</p><gap desc="table"/><p>	Respondents who refused to select an option to the scenarios stated one of two justifications: Either there was not enough information given in the scenario to justify selecting an option, or they simply could not justify selecting an option where there was a risk of ending the life of a living organism (the latter response was particularly true for the negatively framed options).</p></div></div><div type="head_1"><head>FURTHER RESEARCH</head><p>	This paper did not address the three types of environmental scenarios; non charismatic endangered species, charismatic endangered species, and forest resources.  There are, however, some potential predictions about how people choose to answer the scenarios based on the specific environmental issue.</p><p>The intensity of the framing effect will highest for charismatic endangered species scenarios, lower for non-charismatic endangered species scenarios, and lowest for forest remnant scenarios. Similar to analysis conducted on national/international protected values and how they correlate with national/international scenarios, I could run an analysis that tests whether or not specific protected values linearly match scenario choices.  For example will a protected value about non-charismatic wildlife result in lower or absent framing effect for non-charismatic wildlife scenario, but not the other two options?  What is the scope of an issue-specific environmental protected value?</p></div><div type="head_1"><head>IMPLICATIONS</head><p>	Framing effects and deeply engrained protected values are rarely considered in environmental conservation education and research, yet acknowledging that people respond differently to the way in which a question is framed is obviously important. This research showed that positively framed scenarios were much more resilient to the presence of protected values than were negatively framed scenarios, and thus suggests that survey question design can be biased if questions are framed in particular ways.  Specifically, if environmental surveys use close-ended questions where respondents are forced to choose from the given options, results can falsely illustrate overwhelming support or overwhelming opposition.</p></div></div><div type="closer"><div type="bibliography"><head>BIBLIOGRAPHY</head><listBibl><bibl>Baron, J. and Spranca, M.
