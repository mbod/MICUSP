(1)   Larger particles, especially those over 75 mm, may be too thick to allow water to penetrate the pores to the center of the aggregate particle.  Therefore it is critical that the procedure state if the aggregate was oven dried and, if so, how long it was submerged in the water.  In this case, since the data is being found for a concrete mixture (where the aggregate will be in its natural, moist state) the aggregate was continuously submerged.</p><p>Another important procedural point that must be followed to assure reproducible results: The experimenter should assure the aggregate is fully submerged when finding the weight in water.</p></div></div><div type="head_1"><head>Experiment 2:  Specific Gravity and Absorption Capacity of Fine Aggregate</head><div type="head_2"><head>PURPOSE</head><p>The purpose of this experiment is to find both the specific gravity and absorption capacity of the fine aggregate.  This information will be used in the proportioning of concrete mixtures.  Specific gravity is the characteristic generally used to calculate the volume occupied by aggregate.

Obtain approximately 1 kg of fine aggregate that has been continuously submerged to assure that all pores are full; place sample on a large tray.</item><item>2. Use a gently moving current of air (the hair dryer) to dry the aggregate to SSD condition.  Stir the aggregate frequently to assure homogeneous drying.  When the specimen approaches a free flowing condition, continue to the next step.</item><item>3. Use the mold and tamper to test for surface moisture.  Place the mold on the tray, with the larger opening down.  Fill the mold with aggregate to overflowing.  Drop the tamper from a height of 5 mm above the aggregate 25 times, adjusting the drop height to be 5 mm from the lowered aggregate level.  Remove soil from surrounding area and remove the mold.  Slight slumping indicates the aggregate is at SSD condition.  If it retains the shape of the mold, repeat step 2.</item></list></div><div type="head_3"><head>Find weight-volume ratios using Gravimetric Procedure:</head><list><item>4.

The key concept to understanding these terms is understanding the concept of pores in aggregate particles.  A single particle of aggregate has a total volume that includes solids and pores.  At the SSD condition the pores are filled with water and at the OD condition the pores are filled with air.</p><p>Bulk dry specific gravity is   </p><gap desc="formula"/><p>Bulk SSD specific gravity is  </p><gap desc="formula"/><p>Apparent specific gravity is  </p><gap desc="formula"/><p>From these equations, these bulk and apparent specific gravities can be compared.

It is critical that this is performed correctly, because the basis of all calculations relies on the appropriate SSD weight.</p></div></div><div type="head_1"><head>Experiment 3:  Gradation Analysis of Coarse and Fine Aggregates</head><div type="head_2"><head>PURPOSE</head><p>The purpose of this experiment is to determine the particle size distribution for fine and coarse aggregates using the sieve method.

Table 3 gives the sieve gradation analysis for coarse aggregate.  Table 4 gives the sieve gradation analysis for fine aggregate.  Figures 1 and 2, following the data charts, show the particle distribution graphically.  As both the tables and figures demonstrate, both the fine and coarse aggregates do not meet ASTM specifications at some point in the distribution.</p><gap desc="table"/><gap desc="table"/><gap desc="figure"/><p>Figure 1: Cumulative Percent Passing vs. Grain Size for Coarse Aggregate</p><gap desc="figure"/><p>Figure 2: Cumulative Percent Passing vs. Grain Size for Fine Aggregate</p></div><div type="head_2"><head>Discussion – Meeting ASTM Standards (a), and Obtaining Reproducible Results</head><p>(a) In figures 1 and 2 the upper and lower limits for the ASTM standards are plotted in the lighter color.  As demonstrated, both the coarse and fine aggregates do not fully meet ASTM specifications.  The coarse aggregate does not fall in the range specified by ASTM standards for 3 of 4 given standards.  The fine aggregate meets specifications for all sieves besides the #50 and #100 sieves.  This tells us that both specimens are not appropriate for use in construction.</p><p>(b) In order to obtain reproducible results it is crucial that the aggregate is agitated for the appropriate amount of time.  It is also necessary to weigh <i>all</i> aggregate sample retained in a sieve.  Loss of any particles causes error in the calculations.</p></div></div><div type="head_1"><head>Experiment 4:  Unit Weight of Coarse Aggregate</head><div type="head_2"><head>PURPOSE</head><p>The purpose of this laboratory is to determine the minimum and maximum unit weights of coarse aggregate.
